I've spent a considerable amount of time with its features on forms, e-mail marketing, automation, CRM, and landing pages. I think the product does it all pretty well, in an easy-to-use way.\n\nThe best-implemented feature I see is the landing pages. It's super easy to build drag-and-drop landing pages and works on both mobile and desktop browsers. Not very customizable, but very user-friendly. In addition to the landing pages, I enjoyed using the automation feature. It's pretty intuitive.\n\nWithin the two weeks I used it, I faced with some bugs and reported them to the support. The support team is very responsive, and they fix bugs in a fast way.\n\nWhat do you dislike about EngageBay All-in-One Suite?\nWell, the user experience can be better. I'm not sure if it's right to compare EngageBay with HubSpot, but compared with HubSpot, there is a way to go for EngageBay in the experience area. In terms of features, I think the product is quite strong. One thing is that even though it helps you do everything in an easy way, there can be some flexibility on customizations for more professional marketers, or people with a technical background.\n\nAnother and the most major one for me is the branded e-mails. Even though you have a monthly subscription, you still need to buy e-mail credits to send unbranded e-mails. It's still inexpensive compared with relevant products within the field, but it doesn't make sense from my point of view. I would increase the prices but wouldn't charge my customers for having unbranded e-mails.\n\nRecommendations to others considering EngageBay All-in-One Suite:\nWhen you have questions about the product's functions at marketing automation, e-mail marketing or CRM features, be sure to talk with the support, and play with the UI. Not all areas of the product are intuitive; hence, check the UI elements to not miss anything.\n\nWhat problems is EngageBay All-in-One Suite solving and how is that benefiting you?\nEngageBay currently covers my landing page, automation, form, e-mail marketing needs as a single platform.
