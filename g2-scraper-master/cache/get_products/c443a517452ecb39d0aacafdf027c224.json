That will only happen when the sales and marketing teams relentlessly pursue every hot trail at their disposal until such a time when it is converted.\n\nUnfortunately, human beings have finite faculties when it comes to chasing down every conceivable lead. If only there was some tool to aid and assist with the process, making the lives of the professionals easier.\n\nToday, powerful AI solutions are capable of diligently pursuing persons-of-interest on behalf of sales and marketing teams and convey the business proposition in an effective fashion.\nFurthermore, they can optimize their mode of communication so as to maximize the chances of conversion. This includes email, social media messaging, SMS, old-fashioned handwritten notes and even voice calls.\n\nZOE Cadence allows you to use multiple channels to communicate with your prospects. You can select which modes of communication to use and how often.\n\nYou can program ZOE Cadence to reach out to your prospect using the channel of your choice. You can also dictate in what order and frequency channels will be deployed.\n\nMany uninitiated marketers often argue that ZOE Cadence doesn't really bring anything new to the table. What can ZOE Cadence do that a simple email or text messaging campaign cannot?\nZOE Cadence is powered by conversational AI. This means that, unlike any ordinary market communication activity, it is equipped with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning.\n\nIt can not only reach out to your prospects but can also intelligently converse with them. If your prospects reciprocate to your follow-ups, ZOE Cadence can respond to their queries or remarks. It can also schedule meetings depending upon the itinerary of your business interests.\n\nLast but not least, ZOE Cadence can transfer any follow-up activity to a human sales or marketing executive when the lead has matured and is ready to convert into a paying customer.", "product_description": "ZOE Cadence serves the invaluable purpose of automating the crucial business development activity of follow-ups.
