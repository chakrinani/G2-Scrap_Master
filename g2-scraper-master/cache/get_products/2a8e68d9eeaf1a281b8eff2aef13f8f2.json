Powerful functionalities, yet simple interface.\n- Possibility to use our own design for email and landing pages: all seamlessly integrated with the Leadsquared functionality in the background.\n- Simplicity of lead list management + individual emailing. Effectively, the system works now as our CRM: we moved away from SalesForce and use this instead. If your usage of SalesForce functionality is \"basic\", you can consider the alternative of only having Leadsquared: you would have a CRM and marketing automation on one system. Way simpler + the sales team love it: saves time = more calls. (Disclaimer: we run a native website system that can do billing - so you would still need that functionality separately.)\n- Once the prospect clicks on an email link, his browsing history on our website is links automatically to Leadsquared. This applies also retroactively - even for activities that happened before clicking the email links.

Powerful functionalities, yet simple interface.\n- Possibility to use our own design for email and landing pages: all seamlessly integrated with the Leadsquared functionality in the background.\n- Simplicity of lead list management + individual emailing. Effectively, the system works now as our CRM: we moved away from SalesForce and use this instead. If your usage of SalesForce functionality is \"basic\", you can consider the alternative of only having Leadsquared: you would have a CRM and marketing automation on one system.
