A comprehensive ecosystem provides the ability to collect information about end customers from multiple sources, analyze this data and draw conclusions on the optimization of business processes: all in real-time (milliseconds). Synerise offers its own unique, fast-acting database, ready-made machine learning-based business solutions and an open platform that can be adapted to each of your needs.\n\nSynerise is based on three technology pillars:\n1. Terrarium Data Engine\nOur   schema-less,   column   &   row-oriented   database   is   a   scalable,   ultra-fast   tool   that simultaneously processes data-heavy executing analytics and behavioral data to create various business scenarios in real-time. Terrarium is an \"all in one\" DB project that resolves the challenges no  other  available  tool  can  solve.  With  Terrarium  we  didn't  need  to  string  together  several independent third-party technologies, which would result in both higher system complexity and costs. Terrarium enables effective and simultaneous executions of analytical / column and row queries.\n\n2. Cleora.ai\nCleora.ai is one of the fastest graph embedding algorithms in existence. It is an essential element for  systems  operating  on  data  in  the  form  of  a  network  of  connected  nodes.  These  are recommendation systems, systems that predict the existence of connections between users in social  media  (e.g  like  /  follow). Cleora  underpins  some  parts  of  our  ecosystem  and  we continuously implement solutions based on it in many companies.\n\n3.Synerise platform\nSynerise platform collects unique knowledge about each user from multiple sources and creates a  complete  360-degree  customer  profile,  updated  in  real-time. Automate campaigns  and personalize communication via e-mail, SMS, web push and mobile notifications using the intuitive 'drag & drop' editor and ready-to-use templates. Synerise also offers the ability to create various types  of  analyses, ranging from campaign results, by creating indicators with custom KPIs, to creating your own custom dash boards.\n\nThe company has invested extensively in its own intellectual property and employing top AI researchers and data scientists to ensure that its AI Growth Ecosystem is free of vendor locks and fully scalable. The goal is to meet the requirements of international enterprises on the leading edge of innovation and digital transformation.\n\nWe know the joy of winning\nThe development of Synerisein the field of artificial intelligence is confirmed by winning numerous awards (podiums) at international AI competitions alongside such technology giants as Google Deep Mind, Baidu, Nvidiaor Layer6.\n\n* #17 Europe's Fastest Growing Technology Sector Company according to Financial Times & statista.com \n* Microsoft Awards 2017-2019 Winner\n* Winner at Rakuten Data Challenge 2020, 1st place\n* Winner at ACM WSDM Booking.com Data Challenge 2021, 2nd place\n* Winner at ACM KDD Cup OGB-LSC 2021, 3rd place\n* Winner at ACM RecSys Twitter Challenge 2021, 2nd place\n\nBorn in the cloud  and raised by data", "product_description": "The Synerise AI-based Ecosystem leverages real-time data to deliver valuable insights into market opportunities, potential for growth and process efficiency while delivering a 360-degree customer view.", "positioning_against_competitor": null, "reviews": 12, "rating": 4.5, "medal_image": null, "category": {"name": "Marketing Automation Software", "link": "https://www.g2.com/categories/marketing-automation"}, "parent_category": null, "company_id": 41341, "seller": "Synerise", "company_phone": null, "company_location": "San Francisco, California", "company_founded_year": 2013, "company_annual_revenue": null, "total_revenue_usd_mm": null, "company_ownership": null, "discussions_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/synerise/discuss", "supported_languages": "English, Polish, Spanish", "services_offered": null, "twitter": "https://twitter.com/synerise", "number_of_followers_on_twitter": 4291, "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/synerise", "number_of_employees_on_linkedin": 187, "product_website": null, "company_website": null, "is_claimed": true, "categories": [{"name": "Marketing Automation", "link": "https://www.g2.com/categories/marketing-automation"}, {"name": "Personalization", "link": "https://www.g2.com/categories/personalization"}, {"name": "Customer Data Platform (CDP)", "link": "https://www.g2.com/categories/customer-data-platform-cdp"}], "screenshots": [], "videos": [], "download_links": [], "pricing_plans": null, "alternatives": [{"name": "Bloomreach", "link": "https://www.g2.com/products/bloomreach-bloomreach/reviews", "rating": 4, "reviews": 591}, {"name": "Insider", "link": "https://www.g2.com/products/insider/reviews", "rating": 4, "reviews": 973}, {"name": "Klaviyo", "link": "https://www.g2.com/products/klaviyo/reviews", "rating": 4, "reviews": 1035}], "comparisons": [{"link": "https://www.g2.com/compare/bloomreach-bloomreach-vs-synerise", "name": "Bloomreach", "logo": "https://images.g2crowd.com/uploads/product/image/small_square/small_square_9954d1f1b2193bfcf0220bf84917e62e/bloomreach-bloomreach.jpg"}, {"link": "https://www.g2.com/compare/insider-vs-synerise", "name": "Insider", "logo": "https://images.g2crowd.com/uploads/product/image/small_square/small_square_a7586d5dfd42c30b1fe3260f10e1210d/insider.png"}], "features": [], "detailed_features": [], "star_distribution": {"1": 0, "2": 1, "3": 0, "4": 0, "5": 11}, "popular_mentions": ["Ai", "Analytics", "Analytics tools", "Customer", "Customer behavior", "Data", "Data analysis", "Features", "Marketing", "Marketing campaigns", "Platform", "Report", "Results", "Segmentation", "Software"], "g2_reviews_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/synerise/reviews#reviews", "review_links": ["https://www.g2.com/products/synerise/reviews"], "initial_reviews": [{"review_id": 9119282, "review_title": "Robust and advanced data collection and analytics driven by AI", "review_content": "What do you like best about Synerise?\nThe platform provides accurate results as AI is greatly used as it has enough knowledge about what is being asked.
