Here's what we replaced with GreenRope:\n\n1) EMAIL marketing\n2) CRM System\n3) Website tracking and analytics\n4) Event registration\n5) Website chat client\n6) Help desk ticket system\n\nAnd maybe some other stuff I can't remember now... *LOL*  The GreenRope platform brought these all under a single integrated system which made it easy to segregate contacts, do email blasts, track their website activity, announce and manage events, etc.  I think our total cost is about the same as with the other tools but all the data is in one place so we're not cutting and pasting into spreadsheets anymore and trying to get the different apps to talk to each other.  So we are saving time and streamlining our marketing / customer communications.\n\nWhat do you dislike about GreenRope?\nThe GreenRope platform is VERY feature rich which is a good thing.  However, this breadth of feature functionality does have a cost.  The system is not super intuitive to use and the GUI is not as smooth and updated as some other apps.  Because all the functions are integrated, it takes some time to figure out how all the data flows together and there is a LOT more to learn.  In addition, the system is customiseable, which in general is good, but this again results in adding some complexity to the platform.  If you just want a casual CRM system or email blast system, GreenRope is probably more (and more complex) than you need.

GreenRope is not the most intuitive system to use.  If you manage websites, use WordPress and have used EMAIL systems before, you should get the hang of GreenRope and their support has been very good.  But if you are a small business owner and just need to send out an email newsletter once a month, GreenRope may be overkill for you.

What used to take 4 or 5 different tools that did not talk to each other is all handled now by GreenRope which has saved us time and helped us keep in better contact with customers and prospects alike.", "review_question_answers": [{"question": "What do you like best about GreenRope?", "answer": "GreenRope replaced a bunch of tools that we were using (and paying for) that were not connected.  Here's what we replaced with GreenRope:\n\n1) EMAIL marketing\n2) CRM System\n3) Website tracking and analytics\n4) Event registration\n5) Website chat client\n6) Help desk ticket system\n\nAnd maybe some other stuff I can't remember now... *LOL*  The GreenRope platform brought these all under a single integrated system which made it easy to segregate contacts, do email blasts, track their website activity, announce and manage events, etc.  I think our total cost is about the same as with the other tools but all the data is in one place so we're not cutting and pasting into spreadsheets anymore and trying to get the different apps to talk to each other.  So we are saving time and streamlining our marketing / customer communications."}, {"question": "What do you dislike about GreenRope?", "answer": "The GreenRope platform is VERY feature rich which is a good thing.  However, this breadth of feature functionality does have a cost.  The system is not super intuitive to use and the GUI is not as smooth and updated as some other apps.  Because all the functions are integrated, it takes some time to figure out how all the data flows together and there is a LOT more to learn.
