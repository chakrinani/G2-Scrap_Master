I first used it to encourage people to book a ten minute free visit with me.  I definitely noticed an increase in remote clients/patients after installing the widget.

Currently there is no feature to prevent people from cancelling their appointment without a penalty even though the policy states no cancellations within 48 hours.  People can still cancel and are \"surprised\" when they get invoiced a cancellation fee.
