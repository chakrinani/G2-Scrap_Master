The workflow builder is intuitive and there are lots of options to build and customize emails to look and feel the way you want them to.

For example, there was an important campaign that we ran where the branching logic hinged on a date comparison. Contacts were supposed to go down branch A if they entered the sequence before a particular date, and branch B otherwise. It worked fine when we tested prior to launch. On the day we set it live, for some unknown reason the logic went the other way and contacts that were supposed to go down branch A went to branch B and vice-versa.

The workflow builder is intuitive and there are lots of options to build and customize emails to look and feel the way you want them to. The audience filters are powerful in the sense that you can combine contact and company properties together, and still get instant results - something I've not seen in more well known CRMs that I've used.\n\nThey've also got awesome customer support who are really prompt responding, though sometimes the resolutions that they give can be a bit hit and miss.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Ortto?\nTo be honest, there's not much to dislike about Ortto except that they are expensive and glitchy. For example, there was an important campaign that we ran where the branching logic hinged on a date comparison. Contacts were supposed to go down branch A if they entered the sequence before a particular date, and branch B otherwise. It worked fine when we tested prior to launch. On the day we set it live, for some unknown reason the logic went the other way and contacts that were supposed to go down branch A went to branch B and vice-versa. We had to halt the campaign and do damage control. This was just one of multiple glitchiness that we experienced on the platform.

The workflow builder is intuitive and there are lots of options to build and customize emails to look and feel the way you want them to. The audience filters are powerful in the sense that you can combine contact and company properties together, and still get instant results - something I've not seen in more well known CRMs that I've used.\n\nThey've also got awesome customer support who are really prompt responding, though sometimes the resolutions that they give can be a bit hit and miss."}, {"question": "What do you dislike about Ortto?", "answer": "To be honest, there's not much to dislike about Ortto except that they are expensive and glitchy. For example, there was an important campaign that we ran where the branching logic hinged on a date comparison. Contacts were supposed to go down branch A if they entered the sequence before a particular date, and branch B otherwise. It worked fine when we tested prior to launch. On the day we set it live, for some unknown reason the logic went the other way and contacts that were supposed to go down branch A went to branch B and vice-versa. We had to halt the campaign and do damage control. This was just one of multiple glitchiness that we experienced on the platform. Needless to say, we had reliability issues with Ortto after that.\n\nI also dislike that they can't properly attribute a conversion.

We were using Autopilot (same company, slightly different product) and it did its job despite looking wildly outdated and missing many key features (no preview text field in the journey email builder?!). Ortto came along as a completely separate product from Autopilot, and the team started to push us to migrate into Ortto - moving some of the functions out of Autopilot and into Ortto's interface. For a period, support lived only in Ortto so we'd have to log into two separate tools when looking to chat with a rep.

The reporting is not great at all. you can create segments, but once you create one segment, you can't make edits to it. You have to create a whole new one.

It connects almost seamlessly with the tools I use every day which is essential for keeping our team in the know and on the same page.\n\nOther things I like about Autopilot are:\n-It has a ton of integrations with other tools\n-Workflows are really easy to build and are visually appealing. You can also connect something to an existing path rather than building out the same flow in a different branch (something I had to do with HubSpot which was a big waste of time)\n-You can set \"goals\" on your journeys which are super customizable to your company's needs because you can use lists and segments. This is so much more powerful because you can move beyond just email click and open rates\n\nWhat do you dislike about Ortto?\nI would really like for Autopilot to develop native forms. The theme on our website has a variety of forms and pop-ups (the Divi theme with the Bloom plugin, which is a very popular Wordpress theme) but they won't work with Autopilot because it requires me to connect directly with an email provider and Autopilot is not one of them. Typically I could select the option to paste an HTML form, but since this isn't something Autopilot has, I don't have a way of connecting them.\n\nThe problem I now have is that I'm using a form plugin (Ninja Forms) but this can't be read by Autopilot's form reader. The submit buttons aren't actually coded in the right way for Autopilot to recognize them, so I've had to use Zapier to connect these tools. I have my workflow down and this works, but it's a bunch of extra steps for a simple task and it makes it difficult for my team to jump in and help because there are so many programs to coordinate.\n\nThere are form plugins that will work, but I have other criteria I need to consider and Ninja Forms was the best option. It was easier for me to just use Zapier and have my other criteria met by the form than using a plugin that connects well with Autopilot.\n\nThe other things I wish Autopilot did better or had solutions for are:\n-Reporting beyond just emails\n-Ability to customize the fields I see on contact views\n-A section for emails so I didn't have to go through journeys themselves\n-In the email reporting section, I would really like to be able to see the actual contacts in each bucket (opened, clicked, replied, etc) without having to export them or create a list\n-I wish there was a way to have general journey enrollment criteria without having to create segments or lists (similar to how HubSpot is setup). I want to keep my segments and lists clean, and sometimes I need to create a really specific segment for a journey to run. It just makes for unnecessary clutter\n-I wish it was easier to schedule an email at a specific time. It's a bit of a weird process because you can set your jounry live and \"delay\" the email by a certain time but it's a bit odd.

Has native support for a bunch of software solutions out there such as Twilio and Salesforce. Pricing is fair for the features that they offer.\n\nAPI documentation is very good which makes it easy to integrate Autopilot into pretty much anything.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Ortto?\nThe backend of Autopilot is incredibly slow. Simple tasks such as moving a contact to a specific list within a journey can take several minutes at a time to run. This ends up being causing a lot of frustration when you're testing out a journey and you're just sitting there waiting for a contact to move through the journey steps.\n\nThe webhook support is very weak. You can only subscribe to a predetermined list of webhooks available so if you need any functionality outside of that, you'll have to use workarounds. It would be nice to have webhook blocks in the journey creation. Allowing you to send a custom webhook with custom data in a journey would make it much much easier to integrate with other applications.\n\nWhen creating journeys, you cannot keep zooming out indefinitely, as a result, if you have a large journey, it will be impossible to connect a block on the left side to a block on the far right since you can't view them in the same view.\n\n\nRecommendations to others considering Ortto:\nTry it out and see for yourself. If you need something simple then Autopilot should suffice.

Simple tasks such as moving a contact to a specific list within a journey can take several minutes at a time to run. This ends up being causing a lot of frustration when you're testing out a journey and you're just sitting there waiting for a contact to move through the journey steps.\n\nThe webhook support is very weak. You can only subscribe to a predetermined list of webhooks available so if you need any functionality outside of that, you'll have to use workarounds. It would be nice to have webhook blocks in the journey creation. Allowing you to send a custom webhook with custom data in a journey would make it much much easier to integrate with other applications.\n\nWhen creating journeys, you cannot keep zooming out indefinitely, as a result, if you have a large journey, it will be impossible to connect a block on the left side to a block on the far right since you can't view them in the same view.\n"}, {"question": "Recommendations to others considering Ortto:", "answer": "Try it out and see for yourself.

The support has also been phenomenal. From group webinars to one-on-one conversations with the support team, they've gone above and beyond to meet our needs.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Ortto?\nSome key integrations are still missing, most notably Mailchimp. We had many beautiful Mailchimp templates that we were unable to migrate over, despite the bet efforts of the support team. We ended up building new emails in the Autopilot builder, but they are not as visually rich as the ones we had in Mailchimp.

This is very useful because benefits outweights costs totally. We are closer to our customers, are able to increase loyalty, LTV, etc. by keeping constant communication with them.
