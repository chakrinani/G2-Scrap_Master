The different lists of people you can select to send emails to is great as you can edit your message to suit the targeting audience. The dashboard and reports are great for you to monitor what people are clicking on, what they're not opening, etc. Helpful insights for future email campaigns.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Spotler Mail+?\nThe software emails are quite different on a range of platforms, this makes it difficult to finalise a design and position of items on the email. There is also a difficulty with making edits once you have scheduled the email campaign, you can't edit anything you have to delete the whole campaign, make the edits and re-do this work, slightly annoying.

We send thousands of emails in one go, and Pure360 handles this with no hassles whatsoever!\n\nThe drag and drop editor is my saviour!

If i was being really picky, I'd say that it would be useful if you could hyperlink words in the text based emails (like you can with the HTML emails) as the long url links that are used under a text sentence, do not receive as many click throughs (I think they look dubious to an end user). Sorry.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Spotler Mail+:\nI started using CommuniGator 5 years ago as it allowed us to put regular emails and enewsletters together quicker (and cheaper) than it took a design agency to create.  Now we use CommuniGator for more advanced email marketing purposes, such as nurturing warm interests through marketing automation (trigger campaigns) and surveys.\n\nWhat problems is Spotler Mail+ solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThe 'go to market' bottle neck in terms of my time.  There never seems to be enough hours in the day to strategically plan multiple campaigns with multiple vendors and tactically deliver marketing campaigns, and yet the campaigns still have to be created and out the door on time.  I now use CommuniGator's Managed Service which works really well. CommuniGator createsthe emailshots and builds the automated trigger campaigns with all the correct tracking measures in place.
