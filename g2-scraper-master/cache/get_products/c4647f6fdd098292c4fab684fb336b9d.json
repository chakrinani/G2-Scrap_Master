I feel like ReSci has my company's best interest in mind, and it makes the relationship collaborative, enjoyable, and most importantly profitable for both sides.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Retention Science?\nIt hasn't been a perfect fit due to the size of my company, and ReSci's model and core value prop.  Because Retention Science is able to work its magic best with a larger company (larger customer base/emails to leverage the AI services, more consistent/healthier cash flow/inventory position).  There have been times, to no fault of Retention Science's, where we did not have enough inventory (read: no inventory) to generate any sales, let alone send out compelling emails.  As a very small, self-funded company, it has been challenging to meet demand and scale at the ideal rate.  During these out of stock times, it hurts to pay an enterprise-level fee to use ReSci's platform with a start-up-level wallet size.   The large majority of companies at our size would a service that has a lower monthly fee, and less hands-on service based on their budget, but we took a leap of faith joining ReSci because we knew what we could grow into, and their leadership so the same vision as us.  It's amazing that we're starting to grow to a size that allows ReSci's value prop and pricing make sense based on the revenues we bring in.\n\nWhat problems is Retention Science solving and how is that benefiting you?\nRetention Science is helping us accomplish our main objective of getting every single person who wants a pair a of Swoveralls...a pair of Swoveralls!  The email flows and audience insights up to this point have been incredibly helpful, but not necessarily differentiating from what a competitor service could provide.  What separates Retention Science apart from any other eCRM partner is the 1-on-1 customer support I receive from Mayra.

I feel like ReSci has my company's best interest in mind, and it makes the relationship collaborative, enjoyable, and most importantly profitable for both sides."}, {"question": "What do you dislike about Retention Science?", "answer": "It hasn't been a perfect fit due to the size of my company, and ReSci's model and core value prop.  Because Retention Science is able to work its magic best with a larger company (larger customer base/emails to leverage the AI services, more consistent/healthier cash flow/inventory position).  There have been times, to no fault of Retention Science's, where we did not have enough inventory (read: no inventory) to generate any sales, let alone send out compelling emails.  As a very small, self-funded company, it has been challenging to meet demand and scale at the ideal rate.  During these out of stock times, it hurts to pay an enterprise-level fee to use ReSci's platform with a start-up-level wallet size.   The large majority of companies at our size would a service that has a lower monthly fee, and less hands-on service based on their budget, but we took a leap of faith joining ReSci because we knew what we could grow into, and their leadership so the same vision as us.  It's amazing that we're starting to grow to a size that allows ReSci's value prop and pricing make sense based on the revenues we bring in."}, {"question": "What problems is Retention Science solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "Retention Science is helping us accomplish our main objective of getting every single person who wants a pair a of Swoveralls...a pair of Swoveralls!  The email flows and audience insights up to this point have been incredibly helpful, but not necessarily differentiating from what a competitor service could provide.  What separates Retention Science apart from any other eCRM partner is the 1-on-1 customer support I receive from Mayra.  Mayra has an intimate understanding of ReSci and our business, and holds us accountable to implementing her actionable recommendations.  With her help, we are ultimately solving the problem of missed sales.
