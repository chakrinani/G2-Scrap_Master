I could get to the message board just after making a new user; it would eliminate three clicks in the system. In addition, it would be nice to have two users when setting up an account. It's a bummer that we would have to purchase a new 'seat.'

Texts help eliminate all of that by simply being able to message them. And being able to purchase an actual number made it that much better. Lastly, it helps brand awareness as well. I enjoy the keyword feature and being able to connect with those in a group setting. It's nice to send out alerts for new job positions or to keep in contact with those who hold interest within my groups. A significant benefit to having a desktop-accessible application is that we can link it to our email and notifications as the day goes along.

A great and easy way to connect with a very large group that is cost effective without lacking options. I really needed a platform to make communicating with my youth group easier. No one has to downlad an app and turn on notifications. They simply text in the keyword and then are subscribed. It sends my info straight to them as a text message. It is by far the best communication service I have ever used.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Textedly?\nThere isn't much to dislike. I wish I could have a second keyword without a big jump in price. and maybe if textedly had an app that I could use on my end to make sending and responding to text a bit simpler. Other than that, it is a super perfect service and I'm extremely happy with it!

Don't go anywhere else!\n\nWhat problems is Textedly solving and how is that benefiting you?\nAs I stated before, this makes it so easy for me to communicate and send reminders and whatnot to a very large group. Before textedly, I was using an app that each of my students would have to download and then make an account. It was a hassel and most people would either forget to turn on notifications or forget why they had that app and then delete it. This has solved major lapses in communication for us!

Loved that you could upload your contact list easily instead having to manually add each person. Very helpful if you have alot of contacts! Super easy to maintain and the tool to allow scheduling messages at a specific time is also very helpful. You can schedule sereval messages at once and have them all be sent at different times. This allows you plan ahead.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Textedly?\nThe limit on the characters and having to send more than one message at a time, having to break up the message into serval messages. Should increase limit on characters allowed. I would also recommend that they maybe set up a notification system via email, if we arent always signed in into the website. It would be nice to have an email sent to us\n\nRecommendations to others considering Textedly:\nMy advice for users would be to create nd upload your contact list via excel spreadsheet, this will make it much easier for you to upload a large mass or contacts all at once. Instead of one by one manually. However make sure you create the excel spreadsheet in the specific format textdly requires to avoid any error messages.\n\nWhat problems is Textedly solving and how is that benefiting you?\nNo problems at the moment.
