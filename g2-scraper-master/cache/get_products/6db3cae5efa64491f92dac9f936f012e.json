If there is something in your email campaign that is more complex than what is given to you, Act-On will look into it for you and see if they would build it out for you. They want their customers to succeed in their marketing efforts and will look for many ways to optimize your account too.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Act-On?\nThere are not many dislikes I have with Act-On. If I had to choose, I would say that their help articles need some work. I try my best to go there first before I go into their live chat rooms, but some of the articles don't answer my question, or the content in the help article is confusing at times. Other than that, it is solid!\n\nRecommendations to others considering Act-On:\nAct-On is definitely a go-to source of marketing automation if you are looking to send multiple emails monthly to the same contacts. Act-On only counts active unique contacts for your monthly limit, not the total contacts. From my little research, other competitors will only count the total contacts you signed up for.\n\nAct-On is also a good tool for those that work at enterprise levels.\n\nWhat problems is Act-On solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThere is an internal newsletter that we have started sending out back in May 2020. Before that, our CEO would share some company-wide news. Since he was sending them through our email client, we didn't have a way to track who is engaging with the content. We decided to rebrand the news with a bi-weekly newsletter that went through Act-On to the whole company. We were able to gain some amazing insights on where people were clicking throughout the newsletter. With that in place, we could make smarter strategic decisions on what the next content should be.\n\nAnother problem we had was the lack of following up with strong leads from our campaigns. Act-On wasn't always connected to our CRM, so our customer lists were not the most accurate. Since our sales reps work through the CRM, they couldn't determine who was a strong lead. Now that we are connected with our CRM to Act-On, we are able to perform automated email campaigns and send CRM tasks out to those that complete certain call-to-actions.\n\nThis has made our communication efforts more efficient than ever before.

Being able to easily download excel sheets with all pertinent information and data for each individual email is also extremely helpful. In addition, the ability to suppress certain lists of people in each email is very helpful, because often emails are sent multiple times to different groups of people for data tracking purposes. Another feature that has proven to be quite beneficial is the ability to keep and maintain lists of different people and groups. As a company with many different clients, and various offices it is extremely important to be able to generate and save mailing lists for different the many demographics we serve.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Act-On?\nI often find that act-on takes a lengthy time to load from page to page.

Being able to easily download excel sheets with all pertinent information and data for each individual email is also extremely helpful. In addition, the ability to suppress certain lists of people in each email is very helpful, because often emails are sent multiple times to different groups of people for data tracking purposes. Another feature that has proven to be quite beneficial is the ability to keep and maintain lists of different people and groups.

I spend a lot of time (sometimes entire days) making mass updates of the same exact change across all of our marketing emails, landing pages, and templates. We have many templates /automated+triggered emails / landing pages that share similar data / content blocks. It should be possible to save these content blocks and edit them in such a way that it will also update any templates / automated emails / triggered emails that have the content block embedded in them. I've been using custom variables as a workaround to sort of have this capability but it is limited. The content blocks proposed by Act-On (in the works) can be embedded in emails but will not globally update all automated / triggered / etc emails that have the content block in them if the content block is edited, making this upcoming feature close to useless for our needs.\n\nWebinars should be something you can copy / duplicate the setup of. I spend a lot of time setting up individual webinars exactly the same way older webinars are set up with some minor differences Currently I have to re-set up the similar signup form, email reminders, marketing emails, and post-webinar emails for every webinar taking a lot of time when I have to do this for multiple webinars. Also the overall interface for this is clunky when I have to choose templates to base emails off of because I have to scroll through a massive dropdown of all of our email templates to find the ones I need for the webinar.\n\nPreviewing of custom fields and dynamic content needs to be easier. Currently I have set up many email addresses with different variable information and segmentations that allow me to preview dynamic content that look for those variables to display things differently, but this was overly convoluted to set up and requires privileges to actually send emails (because you need to apply the segmented list to the email to preview it) that only I have and some of our template designers don't have (and shouldn't have). Currently custom fields also don't preview properly unless actually composing the email to send and segmenting it as well.\n\nIt should be possible to further customize forms to accept variables based on what page they are on. As it stands I have to set up over 100 forms that are the exact same form just with 1 or 2 hidden variables changed based on the landing page I have the forms embedded on and there is no real way to work around this effectively (believe me I've tried) -- cookied information doesn't work reliably and neither does passing the variables on the URL through custom javascript.\n\nForms should also have the ability to have content block templates set up in such a way that changing the content block would also update any forms that it is used on. Currently I have to regularly update the same exact field on every single form (start semester) we have (think having to update 200+ forms with the same exact change, days worth of unnecessary mindless repetitive work that could easily be bulkified / an instantaneous single global change)\n\nAct-on's web interface has memory leaks, user interface bugs, and the overall interface is slow and clunky compared to modern web apps. I have to run Act-on in a separate web browser and after using it for a while to make changes (particularly editing landing pages) it will slow down the web browser to the point where it will freeze for several seconds on making edits. I'll need to completely shut down the browser and restart it which frees up the memory resources of the browser clearing the memory leaks and allowing me to work with Act-On again. This is a bug we've noticed across all of our users who work with Act-On. I've had to instruct everyone who uses Act-On to open it in a separate web browser and when it begins getting slow to completely exit the web browser and open it again. The memory leaks at least should be investigated and remedied, but the overall interface could use many enhancements to make it more in-line with modern web applications.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Act-On:\nIt's a very useful tool for marketing automation, forms, and landing pages.\n\nWhat problems is Act-On solving and how is that benefiting you?\nWe've integrated forms with Salesforce allowing us to better keep track of and service our prospects and clients.\n\nWe utilize segmentation to send emails to the appropriate people and we use dynamic content to make sure everyone gets the information they need.\n\nWe use automated programs to complete tasks automatically rather than having them be tasks manually completed by our team saving a lot of work and making the team more efficient.", "review_question_answers": [{"question": "What do you like best about Act-On?", "answer": "Act-on is useful for marketing automation, mass emails, forms, and landing pages; it meets many of our needs along with Salesforce integration allowing us to operate much more efficiently with forms and emails as well as integrating dynamic content into our marketing."}, {"question": "What do you dislike about Act-On?", "answer": "There needs to be more bulk editing capabilities.

Here are at least a few in no particular order:\nEase of Use - this tool can help a marketing team accomplish an astronomical amount of initiatives, whether small or large (I've worked with it for both) because it's easy to setup.  Within one month I was able to setup multiple automated programs.\nCustomer Support - I feel like they are my friends.  I talk to them often, not because of issues but because I ask a lot of questions and they are always there to help right away.\nCustomization - the tool may seem basic at first glance, however you can customize so many different areas to work exactly how you need it to for your business.  They don't try to mold you into specific things, they work right into your marketing landscape.\nInnovation - I've been using Act On for over 5 years now. I've seen it grow. I've seen my feature suggestions get implemented, and not long after they are asked.  The tool is constantly evolving and product management truly listens to their customers on new features.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Act-On?\nThe one thing that we would really like to see within the tool is better tracking on forms behind the scenes as far as first source and last source directly from their cookie that they set. We had to create our own to truly capture this information.\nGoogle Adwords - their report is great, however there are limitations. It only shows people clicking through ads that are visiting your website for the first time and submit a form during that session.  This needs to be expanded to accommodate for attribution models that may consider someone a conversion if they come back within 90 days, etc.\nSalesforce Sync - Act-On will push things directly to Salesforce upon a form submit or through an automated program, however list syncs from Salesforce to Act-On are limited and can be done every 4 hours (unless manual push). It would be better if the lists would just automatically sync in real-time.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Act-On:\nAct-On might not have recognition that Marketo or Eloqua have (yet) but their tool is just as effective, if not more.  I've done many demos with the other systems and could not find a reason that they were any better than Act-On, even with price not being a factor.  You can get all the major benefits for a fraction of the cost with Act-On.\n\nWhat problems is Act-On solving and how is that benefiting you?\nWe have a small marketing team in regards to people and Act-On lets us maximize our time and efforts to reach our audience as if we had 100 team members. We have been able to better segment and target our audience to provide more relevant content which has increased our engagement.

The performance - very slow to load. The support - they stonewalled us when we asked them to address some issues.\n\nIn more details, we used Act-On for about a year, and saw a variety of problems. Here are some of them:\n\nDowntime and unavailability. My customers/visitors repeatedly and publicly complained about not getting downloads they signed up for. After clicking through a form and filling out their information, instead of downloading an ebook they'd get a 404 not found error on Act-On's servers. Act-On denied that this could possibly happen and refused to even investigate it seriously. I found it unconscionable that they would blame us or just close support tickets without even trying to do something simple like look at server logs. Meanwhile I was getting a black eye on social media, and it's a lose lose situation because if you say \"I'm trying to fix this problem but my vendor's systems are broken\" you look even worse, so I ended up just emailing a bunch of PDFs to people personally who were trying to download but could not. This was not an isolated incident, it happened over the space of months and months.\n\nIntegration with SalesForce. Instead of really integrating with SalesForce, they keep a \"walled garden\" around the data and link to a page within Act-On. So in SalesForce, when you're looking at activity history for example and you see an email or something, you click into it and it's just a link to a page within Act-On.

My engineers were horrified at the quality of the Act-On code. They warned me repeatedly that by embedding Act-On's snippets and forms into our pages, we were exposing our customers and visitors to genuinely insecure code.

Ability to create and send html emails and newsletters to targeted lists (we no longer need the web team to develop html emails). Website activity and email reports provide valuable feedback on open, click and deliverability rates so we can track, analyze and act on the data. Pre-designed templates allow the sales team to quickly send emails from Salesforce to a hot prospect based on where they are at in the sales process. It's easy to create landing pages and forms (with automatic thank you emails) that we link to our website, and we can edit them within minutes. Trigger/drip marketing campaigns allow us to stay in touch with our customers and prospects with targeted content. Most important, Act-on provides a level of service, training, and customer support that is far better than any vendor I've worked with in the past. Everyone we've worked with at Act-on is highly professional, friendly and knowledgeable, and there when we need them.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Act-On?\nEntering generic email aliases can be time consuming as you have to enter each one individually versus downloading a list.

Ability to create and send html emails and newsletters to targeted lists (we no longer need the web team to develop html emails). Website activity and email reports provide valuable feedback on open, click and deliverability rates so we can track, analyze and act on the data. Pre-designed templates allow the sales team to quickly send emails from Salesforce to a hot prospect based on where they are at in the sales process. It's easy to create landing pages and forms (with automatic thank you emails) that we link to our website, and we can edit them within minutes. Trigger/drip marketing campaigns allow us to stay in touch with our customers and prospects with targeted content. Most important, Act-on provides a level of service, training, and customer support that is far better than any vendor I've worked with in the past. Everyone we've worked with at Act-on is highly professional, friendly and knowledgeable, and there when we need them."}, {"question": "What do you dislike about Act-On?", "answer": "Entering generic email aliases can be time consuming as you have to enter each one individually versus downloading a list.

The interface makes it easy (and working with your success coach will streamline the learning curve), but it's critical you have your marketing funnels and drip campaigns ironed out BEFORE you get on Acton.\n\nAlso, I found their social media integration weak at best.  However, given that really none of the competitors in the automation/lead gen industry are doing any better it was something that I could easily overcome.  Just simply work with a more powerful social media dashboard.  Simple.\n\nOne thing I would love for Acton to integrete, however would be a more central dashboard for analytics, even if these where API driven.

Also Acton understands that extraordinary marketing involves both proactive (direct or interruption) marketing and attraction (inbound) marketing to be truly successful.
