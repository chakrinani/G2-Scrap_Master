Mautic is Feature Rich. Its primary function is to provide Marketing Automation capabilities in unlimited use and functionality.\n2. Although there is limited CRM built in, the APIs included in Mautic allows you to connect to several CRM products dedicated to that function, leaving Mautic free to perform Marketing Automation.\n3. Unlimited users and unlimited roles\n4. Unlimited custom fields for data specific to our business model.\n5. Unlimited Campaigns - Build as many campaigns as often as you like.\n6. Unlimited Email capabilities, and it only costs ten cents for every 1,000 emails sent.\n7. Campaign Scheduling is unlimited - we break 50,000 contacts into 20 daily transmissions (2,500 each) - this helps with our daily site visitors and improves our SEO\n8. Unlimited Lead Scoring - Assign points to contacts for each action they take and move them into other campaigns. Assign tags and categories to indicate what they were interested in.\n9. Unlimited Contacts - Unlimited contacts can be stored in Mautic. Those contacts can be assigned to Companies so that I can review a company and see who all the contacts are.\n10. Pro-Active marketing - something that cannot be done with any of the online marketing solution providers.\n11. Cost - I've used Mautic for about 3+ years in various versions. Using Mautic 4.2.0 currently after the upgrade. The entire implementation was about $500 to install and about $50 per month for hosting, and 10 cents for every 1,000 emails that I send.  I have been helping other SMBs to implement their own in-house Marketing Automation system for the same price, and they are amazed. One of the principal online marketing providers wants $800 a month for less capabilities. So there is a huge savings!\n12. Capabilities - Mautic is great for startup businesses - IF YOU GET PROPER TRAINING! It is not an easy platform to learn to use because of the openness and breadth of the features. Once users are adequately trained, the solution will grow with the business up to the Enterprise level.\n13. External connectivity to other products like email template builders, SMS messaging services, social media, CRM products, Voice over IP Phones and more.\n14. Campaign cloning: This feature will be invaluable if you have an extensive campaign with many automations and many email links to assign tags, categories or other automations.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Mautic 3.3.2?\n3.3.2 and 4.2.0 are the same:\n1. It is complex at first and can be intimidating. IT REQUIRES A MINIMUM OF 1 to 2 WEEKS OF \"peering-over-the-shoulder\" TRAINING. Now that we have learned it, we provide this help to other users, FREE OF CHARGE, because a tool is only enjoyed if you know how to use it properly. FREE TRAINING if we install the solution and see that it is appropriately set up to proper specifications and with specific 3rd party connections.\n2. Some little things occur like errors \"Failed to execute campaign event for XXX.\" When there are many of these, you cannot dismiss them in bulk. Instead, it would help if they could be dismissed in bulk. There is no impact on Mautic functionality, it is just distracting to see the warning message constantly.\n3. Version Update notifications - the button to \"Upgrade Now.\" NEVER CLICK THIS BUTTON!!!! At least not with current versions. A qualified IT technician must perform upgrades. This message cannot be cleared or turned off if you intend to remain with your current version.\n4. Contacts who do not unsubscribe from emails but instead mark emails as SPAM (I'm guilty of this too ... because we are all learning not to click on email links. Also, It's easier to mark an email as SPAM. Mautic has no automated means to handle these scenarios, so it needs to be resolved manually with every campaign.\n\nWhat problems is Mautic 3.3.2 solving and how is that benefiting you?\n1. One issue we used to experience is cloning campaigns sometimes fail. Cloning campaigns have been rock solid in the newer versions. Cloning campaigns allows you to automatically copy a previous campaign. This is an excellent feature if you have a campaign with many automations and many email links to assign points, tags or categories.\n2. 4.2.0 - Webforms are easier to create and embed in websites to capture customer information. They removed a useful feature that we hope they bring back - the ability to add attachments to customer emails from within Mautic.

Mautic is Feature Rich. Its primary function is to provide Marketing Automation capabilities in unlimited use and functionality.\n2. Although there is limited CRM built in, the APIs included in Mautic allows you to connect to several CRM products dedicated to that function, leaving Mautic free to perform Marketing Automation.\n3. Unlimited users and unlimited roles\n4. Unlimited custom fields for data specific to our business model.\n5. Unlimited Campaigns - Build as many campaigns as often as you like.\n6. Unlimited Email capabilities, and it only costs ten cents for every 1,000 emails sent.\n7. Campaign Scheduling is unlimited - we break 50,000 contacts into 20 daily transmissions (2,500 each) - this helps with our daily site visitors and improves our SEO\n8. Unlimited Lead Scoring - Assign points to contacts for each action they take and move them into other campaigns. Assign tags and categories to indicate what they were interested in.\n9. Unlimited Contacts - Unlimited contacts can be stored in Mautic. Those contacts can be assigned to Companies so that I can review a company and see who all the contacts are.\n10. Pro-Active marketing - something that cannot be done with any of the online marketing solution providers.\n11. Cost - I've used Mautic for about 3+ years in various versions. Using Mautic 4.2.0 currently after the upgrade. The entire implementation was about $500 to install and about $50 per month for hosting, and 10 cents for every 1,000 emails that I send.  I have been helping other SMBs to implement their own in-house Marketing Automation system for the same price, and they are amazed. One of the principal online marketing providers wants $800 a month for less capabilities. So there is a huge savings!\n12. Capabilities - Mautic is great for startup businesses - IF YOU GET PROPER TRAINING! It is not an easy platform to learn to use because of the openness and breadth of the features. Once users are adequately trained, the solution will grow with the business up to the Enterprise level.\n13. External connectivity to other products like email template builders, SMS messaging services, social media, CRM products, Voice over IP Phones and more.\n14. Campaign cloning: This feature will be invaluable if you have an extensive campaign with many automations and many email links to assign tags, categories or other automations.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Mautic 3.3.2?\n3.3.2 and 4.2.0 are the same:\n1. It is complex at first and can be intimidating. IT REQUIRES A MINIMUM OF 1 to 2 WEEKS OF \"peering-over-the-shoulder\" TRAINING. Now that we have learned it, we provide this help to other users, FREE OF CHARGE, because a tool is only enjoyed if you know how to use it properly. FREE TRAINING if we install the solution and see that it is appropriately set up to proper specifications and with specific 3rd party connections.\n2. Some little things occur like errors \"Failed to execute campaign event for XXX.\" When there are many of these, you cannot dismiss them in bulk. Instead, it would help if they could be dismissed in bulk. There is no impact on Mautic functionality, it is just distracting to see the warning message constantly.\n3. Version Update notifications - the button to \"Upgrade Now.\" NEVER CLICK THIS BUTTON!!!! At least not with current versions. A qualified IT technician must perform upgrades. This message cannot be cleared or turned off if you intend to remain with your current version.\n4. Contacts who do not unsubscribe from emails but instead mark emails as SPAM (I'm guilty of this too ... because we are all learning not to click on email links. Also, It's easier to mark an email as SPAM. Mautic has no automated means to handle these scenarios, so it needs to be resolved manually with every campaign.\n\nWhat problems is Mautic 3.3.2 solving and how is that benefiting you?\n1. One issue we used to experience is cloning campaigns sometimes fail. Cloning campaigns have been rock solid in the newer versions. Cloning campaigns allows you to automatically copy a previous campaign. This is an excellent feature if you have a campaign with many automations and many email links to assign points, tags or categories.\n2. 4.2.0 - Webforms are easier to create and embed in websites to capture customer information. They removed a useful feature that we hope they bring back - the ability to add attachments to customer emails from within Mautic.
