We also like that Referrizer allows us to track our students earned points for referrals and class attendance, then they get incentives for collecting points. We also use the Reputation piece to get reviews that automatically post to Google. Seriously, Referrizer is a great tool to help you in many aspects of your business. I use it everyday to help keep leads ingaged and current students in the know of what's going on in our studio. The onboarding was straight forward and easy to follow. I would highly recommend Referrizer!!"}, {"question": "What do you dislike about Referrizer?", "answer": "The only thing I wish were an option deals with contact management. I would like to be able to edit contacts as a group instead of having to do it one by one. For example, I wish I could select a group from my contacts and create a new tag with all of those contacts. Or select contacts from a current group and mass edit them from that tag to another."}, {"question": "What problems is Referrizer solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "Referrizer is mostly helping us with marketing and allowing us to put great offers out there.
