There's a CRM, a task manager, a fully-fledged marketplace with a variety of price points and industries, and more. Vendasta's customer support is pretty good. They're very quick to answer questions and will make occasional exceptions to improve the customer experience. The biggest selling points of Vendasta are their wide array of services, their automation tools that help you easily bring new clients through the pipeline from prospect to partner, and the support for partners from the management level.\n\nEDIT: I do not like anything about Vendasta. It fulfills 0 of the promises it makes.\n\nAfter leaving my first negative review of Vendasta, they offered me 6 months of their team membership susbcription for free. I accepted, thinking I might as well start using more of the features and hopefully enjoying the software. Once I started digging into the platform more, though, I realized the actual marketing \"automation\" Vendasta offers is horrendous.\n\nFor one, you can't integrate a native form on your website into their email marketing software. They also don't work with Zapier. Essentially, Vendasta promises to be an \"agency in a box,\" but can't perform any of the necessary features (white label, pipeline management, sales support). You end up needing to pay for additional services like Mailchimp and Calendly ON TOP of Vendasta because the platform is that god d*mn awful. Not to mention, their CRM and task manager are nearly unusable. I would highly recommend a combination of GoHighLevel and Notion over Vendasta any day of the week.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Vendasta?\nVendasta promises to do a lot of things: marketing automation, white label, CRM, and task manager.\n\nIt does NONE of those things.\n\nMy original review focused on the white label downfalls; I'll leave that below. This one is going to be about the rest of the mess.\n\nVendasta is a marketing automation platform that doesn't automate much. Today, I was just told that I can't embed their meeting booking tool directly into my webpages with HTML and I can't automatically import leads from my native contact forms (Elementor) into their email marketing software.\n\nNow, I will have to pay for Mailchimp and Calendly on top of Vendasta to perform the same basic tasks. If I had GoHighLevel, this would not be a problem.\n\nNobody should ever pay for Vendasta. I write these reviews so that their sales team can't swindle future agency owners, small and large, like they swindled me. I will not stop until Vendasta offers me early termination.\n\nI strongly encourage you to check out GoHighLevel. From what I've heard from my mentors, it seems to be the software of choice for marketing automation.\n\n\n\n\n\nI also dislike the Vendasta marketing services team.\n\nVendasta markets itself as a white-label solution. On their home page, they write: \"Find products to sell, market with ease, and fulfill under your brand. With Vendasta, you can deliver an amazing experience for your customers and truly make a difference.\"\n\nMoreso than their CRM, client dashboard, or their marketing automation tools, their big promise is that they provide white-label services. Thus, this review is through the lens of Vendasta as a white-label agency.\n\nUnlike a lot of other white label agencies (51 blocks, Agency Elevation) that charge you on a per-account basis (i.e. Agency Elevation charges fixed rates starting at $300 per Google Ads account), Vendasta makes you pay $6,000 upfront for access to their marketing services team and then makes you pay again by taking a % of ad spend.\n\nAs a white-label agency, it's way more expensive than its competitors, but the service does not appear to be that much better. I've used their Google Ads service for one account and their social media management service for another. I've been DRASTICALLY disappointed by both. The marketing services team has dropped the ball so hard that I'm feeling compelled to update this review for a second time.\n\nThe Google Search Ads copy I received on my first account read like it was written by a non-English speaker. Whatever copy wasn't pulled straight from the client's website sounded clunky and awkward. I found typos and inconsistent punctuation (dashes) as well.\n\nThe campaign has been a disaster. A total disaster. The client had previously run a campaign that spent $500 in the first month and saw 17 conversions from non-branded keywords. Vendasta's team has spent $500 and seen 1 conversion. The worst part is that I've had to come in and essentially manage the campaign myself, and the marketing services team can't even follow my direct instructions.\n\nFor example, I notice that most of our clicks were coming from a recipes page on our website. Naturally, I direct them to write a new ad group specifically for recipe keywords that would take visitors directly to the recipes page on the website. I provided the exact URL I wanted traffic to go to. The team came back a day later saying they created the ad group and are directing traffic to a specific recipe....WHY? Aside from not being a good idea, it's not what I asked for. Why am I paying them for this??\n\nI told them the margin for the product was about $40. They started bidding on keywords that had CPCs of $6-7. I sent them a keyword list full of broad match keywords to replace their expensive phrase and exact match terms. It took them a week to change the keywords. On our strategy call, the PPC tech went back and forth with me when I told her I wanted to move all of the spend to shopping ads, since that's what was working before. She reasoned that \"Google Ads take time to optimize,\" my response was: \"I understand, I've run a couple of these myself, but the client got 38 conversions in their first month with a $500 campaign created by a FREE Google Ads specialist. If we spend $1,000 + $500 management and get ONE, there's not going to be a month 2. We're supposed to be the experts here.\"\n\nIt's funny how much back and forth there is. I shouldn't have to argue with the people I'm PAYING to manage a Google ads campaign for me. If this was someone on Upwork, I would have fired them way before this could ever happen.\n\nAs for social media, the posts were off-brief and I had to archive them. In our pre-launch call, I showed examples of content I liked and topics I wanted to talk about. When asked, I explicitly said, \"No, I do not want to post stock photos.\" If the team had simply told me \"we're not capable of creating those types of content,\" I would have said \"Okay,\" and pulled the plug. Instead, they were agreeable and scheduled out 3 months of stock photos with cookie-cutter generic copy.\n\nHad I sold this service to a client, instead of trying it on my account, I would have been very embarrassed. The lack of communication of expectations was unprofessional and disappointing.\n\nThere seem to be good strategists among the administration and management levels at Vendasta; I've spoken with them and deeply enjoyed the conversation. The talent you actually get, however, is embarassing. On our strategy call, Vendasta's PPC tech dared to tell me the campaign was running super successfully, likely reading off a script, after I spent the first 15 minutes talking to the account manager about why the campaign WASN'T doing well.\n\nI wish the same talent that's present at the management level existed at the execution level. I expected more premium services because they're priced much higher than other white-label agencies. Unfortunately, it feels like working with someone overseas from Fiverr or Upwork -- lots of oversight is required. I will likely not be renewing, or downgrading to the most basic package, for year 2.\n\nIt seems like Vendasta doesn't know what it's trying to be. It's priced like HighLevel and has many of the same features, but it markets itself like a white-label solution. As a HighLevel competitor, it lacks some key features like a funnel builder and a white-label dashboard. As a white-label agency, it's more expensive for work that isn't any better.\n\nWhat is Vendasta's unique value proposition supposed to be?\n\nRecommendations to others considering Vendasta:\nYou must have a good understanding of your business model before you begin, otherwise the tools won't help you.\n\nDO NOT upgrade Vendasta for access to their marketing services team. Vendasta's best products come from their 3rd party vendors -- you absolutely do not need any level of service higher than the basic $40/month package.\n\nIf you need more team members and use the marketing automation, it might be worth it, but I'm sure there are cheaper solutions out there.\n\nWhat problems is Vendasta solving and how is that benefiting you?\nVendasta helps me fulfill SEO. For example, I spent days interviewing SEO specialists on Upwork.
