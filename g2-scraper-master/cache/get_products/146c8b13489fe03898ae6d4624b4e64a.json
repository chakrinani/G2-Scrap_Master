It is a great tool with a very easy to use interface. It is simple to create templates and very quick to execute campaigns. Instant analytics are then available to view after sending campaigns. When we first engaged with XP, we were up and running in a very short period of time and were sending campaigns out within 6 weeks which was phenomenal turnaround time to get a new tool implemented and working. We had first class engagement from the very start with access to CEO, CTO and account manager on a regular basis. They are always available for a call if there any issues or you need any advice on the tool itself or trying to launch new marketing initiatives.  They helped us with training courses/documentation and guided us on best practices that other clients use which really helped to embed the tool with end users. They go the extra mile to know our business well which really helps as they understand the customer journey and how they interact with the website and our many products. They are always proactive with ideas and when we engage in projects or change requests, they have a strong team who deliver quickly. Customer support is always on hand when required and respond to queries quickly.\n\nDuring the pandemic, when external communications ramped down, we started to use the XP platform for internal communications by using APIs to integrate with Microsoft Outlook to synch email addresses and email distribtion lists. This has really helped us to be more efficient communicating important messages to staff for things like roster changes, training and compliance courses, weekly comms, personalised messages, covid return to work protocols, etc. In the past, we would have had to send physical letters, generic emails, multiple emails to different employees, multiple phone calls. However,  with XP, we were able to send one campaign to 100s of employees using dynamic variables to communicate personal details to each employee. We were able to track engagement levels across different departments which is great to get instant feedback to know employees are receiving important messages. We supplemented this with SMS to tell employees to check company email for important notices. For front line staff, this has changed the game for how we communicate to them.\n\nOverall, we are delighted using the XP platform and I have no hesitation in recommending them to other companies to use., You won't be disappointed!\n\nWhat do you dislike about Xtremepush?\nThere is nothing I dislike about the tool. They have regular SaaS updates, which are constantly adding new features and fixing any bugs. If we have change requests, these would be released on a regular basis as part of these upgrades. If we have any issues, they are always quick to respond, and the phone line is always open, even outside core hours, from CEO down to make sure any problems are resolved quickly.\n\nWhat problems is Xtremepush solving and how is that benefiting you?\nWe have a robust process in place now with XP to manage permissions across our business, and XP is an excellent tool for communicating with customers. We are able to set up different projects on the platform for different business units and can control access to these easily on the platform.\nAs described above, the internal comms through XP has been excellent and not something we ever thought we would use the platform for, but it has been a game-changer using dynamic variables to send one email to 100s of employees with personalized content.", "review_question_answers": [{"question": "What do you like best about Xtremepush?", "answer": "We have been using Xtreme Push for 3 years, primarily for email marketing but also some SMS and web push/pop-ups as well.
