Prebuilt tactics have been incredibly helpful in order to get revenue-driving automation programs live quickly, across multiple channels, which is essential for us as such a small team managing 5 brands.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Emarsys?\nDuring implementation, we had to design our own email template. We appreciated the freedom of this and how this could be tailored to our different brands, but it would be great if Emarsys could provide a prebuilt best-practice template, with the option to add custom blocks afterwards.\n\nWhat problems is Emarsys solving and how is that benefiting you?\n1. Cross-Channel Marketing:\nEmarsys allows us to provide a more seamless experience across multiple customer touchpoints, including digital ads, email, mobile and web. Previously these channels were siloed but now we can create a complete journey with automated journeys or one-off campaigns, personalised to the customer.\n\n2. Increasing revenue from different customer lifecycle groups:\nWith our previous customer engagement platforms, the customer lifecycle wasn't something we focused on.

Getting new features for your daily work and getting a exclusive training is very helpful and not the usual case I guess. For me, this is the best possible service. Web channel is helpful to us as well. Also the implementation of new features was really quick and we were able to use it days after signing the contract. More over we have regular calls to discuss problems or talk about progress or open questions. Great customer service. Before using this new features like overlays I only knew Emarsys as an Newsletter platform - but this is not the case so we can use tools which promote our company, products and reach more people - without the training we would probably not be able to use all the features as efficient as we can do now - so I am really thankful that we had 1,5 hours to get used to the features and as questions. The last small problems we had were all solved within days - the training for examples was also organized within 2 weeks after we signed the contract (which was because this was the earliest we could make it) so we did not loose any time having new features but not being able to use them. Now after the training we are ready to start. One more big advantage is, that the training was recorded so now we can watch it over and over or even show it to other colleagues if there are open questions or we have to train new colleagues to use the features. Furthermore we can use the videotrainings or sign up for more seminars/webinars - as all of them are for free this is really a great offer. Another feature which we can now use without programing anything in our shop environment is discounts/vouchers for our customers - as our Newsletter is gaining more and more subscribers and importance this is a powerful tool and feature to gain even more subscribers. As we only sent 1 Newsletter per week before Covid we are now sending 2-3 newsletters per week and gain new revenues week by week. For me this is a really helpful tool and with the training yesterday I feel like i know everything for the features I want to use in future. Now we can improve our marketing more and more.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Emarsys?\nUntil now, actually nothing. All good - i like working with Emarsys and learning more about it regulary - either by getting personal trainings or using video trainings. This was my second training/webinar and so far there is nothing to complain about. I would recommend Emarsys to others without having a bad feeling about it. The only thing which somebody could dislike is, that without the training some features might be a bit hard to understand in the beginning - but as we got a training this case does not apply to me. In the beginning when I started working with Emarsys the customer support wasn't as good as now - we had a Key Account Manager but communication was not as good as now and we had do wait for answers quite a long time. More over, which we already explained, we are not able to track revenues which were gained by mobile users - but this topic will be discussed and we are no awaiting an answer on that specific problem. My personal downside is the Automation as this is really hard to understand for me - but also for that, there are But all in all I must say that with the trainings we got now and all the new features we have a huge advantage in our work and as we participate with a team of 3 we now got all the things we need to know and can start working with Emarsys and its features.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Emarsys:\nMy recommendation: definitely use the offered trainings and webinars. They make sense and help you with your everyday work - ask questions and contact your Key Account Manager or support if there are open questions or problems. If you can use as many features as possible to find out which works best for you regarding usability and of course, success (revenue, CTR, and so on). The tools are easy to handle but there is much to learn so start with webinars and learn what you can do and state goals - so you can see how successful your campaign was and to see what could be improved. Organize regular meetings with your Emarsys Key Account Manager and write down questions to discuss them in  a call - this is way better than trying out or using Emarsys in a try and error kind of way. Don't be afraid of asking. And one more thing: if you have, also try to introduce a colleague of yours to the project and to the tool so you have somebody who also knows the system.\n\nWhat problems is Emarsys solving and how is that benefiting you?\nWe can reach more customers by using new functions. We can track the results and success of campaigns, and the most significant benefit is that we can now decide which kind of customers we want to use - and we don't need to update or change settings in our own shop environment. It is not a considerable effort but a great benefit - either by using overlays or the regular newsletter. We can reach our personalized target groups or inform shop visitors about discounts or other company-related news if needed. For example we used overlays, while using the test version, to inform our customers that our telephone system broke down - so every visitor of our shop got this information straight away. More over we promoted new store openings and used targeted overlays only for that region - so we could reach potential new customers for those stores.

Since Emarsys is able to consume our large (200k+ SKU) catalog, it makes life easier when building ad-hoc email campaigns. The use of the template for ad-hoc emails is also very helpful. We are able to style our emails in various ways, but again without taking too much time. Product Recommendations is definitely a plus.  We see a larger click-thru and conversion rate on recommended items in emails since it is making the content more focused to the individual who is receiving and opening the email. Additionally while building out an email, before it is sent you can review the likelyhood of spam and overall rating of the general content of your email.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Emarsys?\nI have been on Emarsys for about 30 days or so, and I have yet to find anything that really stands out to dislike. There is a bit of a learning curve from my old provider. As an example, you cannot import contacts into an existing list via the file upload. Instead you have to create a new list, then create what they call, combined segments, to join the lists together. However; this can be overcome if you are using their API to directly add/update/remove contacts from a list.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Emarsys:\nFor our small team, using Emarys's Services and creative team helped make the process much faster and smoother, and we got another set of creative direction that turned out great.\n\nWhat problems is Emarsys solving and how is that benefiting you?\nMuch easier to load product data, the amount of time to build ad-hoc emails is drastically reduced. Segmentation is also much easier to use. Emarsys also provides product recommendations within emails and also on the website. I have noticed increased click-thru and conversion rate on those items. Additionally, we had Emarsys completely re-design all of our email automations.

While we rarely have issues with the platform, when we do, we are getting quick and accurate support that isn't just copy/paste answers. Their team is extremely knowledgeable about their own product and helpful with finding solutions quick enough to support our e-commerce company.\n\nAdditionally, the platform itself is our favorite of those we've used. It has a streamlined approach so it's extremely efficient for our team to use, but Emarsys also hasn't cut out the needed features to have an extremely personalized approach to our customers. The platform is always evolving and having new features come out in Beta trials or even as free upgrade improvements. We couldn't be much happier than we have been since launching with Emarsys in 2016.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Emarsys?\nWhile pricing is absolutely competitive, it's not the most streamlined model. While typical conversations with email providers are around how many emails you want to send, Emarsys has the added component of pricing around how many email addresses are being stored within the database (which powers tons of personalization features we love). It just makes the conversation a bit clunky, though it hasn't been a blocker as we are about to sign our next 3 year extension.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Emarsys:\nCount how many people you have working on emails in your current team and consider what their pain points are in your current email solution. Where is time being drained from their efficiency? What makes them just want to pull their hair out about your current platform? Dig into those areas with Emarsys and get to understand what their solution would do for your team's time and sanity.

The migration to Emarsys has been a huge win for our company!", "review_question_answers": [{"question": "What do you like best about Emarsys?", "answer": "After our company has worked with several of the top email platforms over the last decade, I can say without a doubt that Emarsys is #1 in customer support. While we rarely have issues with the platform, when we do, we are getting quick and accurate support that isn't just copy/paste answers. Their team is extremely knowledgeable about their own product and helpful with finding solutions quick enough to support our e-commerce company.\n\nAdditionally, the platform itself is our favorite of those we've used. It has a streamlined approach so it's extremely efficient for our team to use, but Emarsys also hasn't cut out the needed features to have an extremely personalized approach to our customers. The platform is always evolving and having new features come out in Beta trials or even as free upgrade improvements. We couldn't be much happier than we have been since launching with Emarsys in 2016."}, {"question": "What do you dislike about Emarsys?", "answer": "While pricing is absolutely competitive, it's not the most streamlined model. While typical conversations with email providers are around how many emails you want to send, Emarsys has the added component of pricing around how many email addresses are being stored within the database (which powers tons of personalization features we love). It just makes the conversation a bit clunky, though it hasn't been a blocker as we are about to sign our next 3 year extension."}, {"question": "Recommendations to others considering Emarsys:", "answer": "Count how many people you have working on emails in your current team and consider what their pain points are in your current email solution. Where is time being drained from their efficiency? What makes them just want to pull their hair out about your current platform? Dig into those areas with Emarsys and get to understand what their solution would do for your team's time and sanity. I was the person building and sending emails in 2016 when we did this exercise and can say personally how impactful the conversation was to driving change for more success in our program."}, {"question": "What problems is Emarsys solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "We had four people doing email with another larger ESP but now have a team of only 1.5 people due to all of the efficiency gains through better technology.

I love their optional content for blocks plus their block style settings. Getting that built out by the internal template team to be really easy to use and effective for our live text emails, etc. has been a huge boon to our design and CRM teams.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Emarsys?\nEmarsys' doesn't have a perfect solution for a complex business like ours. We've made great incremental strides with relational data service, but the size of our data and the demanding joins we need to perform between tables and views causes some issues for Emarsys in general. I also think that the scripting language support isn't awesome, so we've had some trouble personalizing and if we didn't have a team on a specific project, I'm not sure we would have gotten things done correctly. More real-time data via APIs and better data connectivity to send engagement data back to internal data lakes would go a long way as well as continuing to build out their mobile offering.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Emarsys:\nFor simple retail use cases (i.e. pure-play or omnichannel retailing) that is 24/7 and sells discrete things (i.e. not a marketplace), Emarsys is a useful tool that can help your team send out emails and pushes in an efficient manner. There are some interesting use cases for their new Tactics capabilities for aligning simple goals and setting forecasts. You are limited to a certain amount of fields against contact records and if you opt for the relational data solution, please have the resources in house to manage the segment templates (SQL) and personalization (scripting language). Also, consider the hosted version where you, as the brand, hosts your own versus Emarsys hosting. Real-time use cases, sophisticated mobile brands, and brands with large data orgs hungry for engagement data should probably keep looking.\n\nWhat problems is Emarsys solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThe biggest thing that happened when we moved to Emarsys is the build-out of more and more complex automated campaigns as well as push messaging in particular. We've seen 6x the revenue per message from push v. email and we have 23+ campaigns versus 4 when we started.
