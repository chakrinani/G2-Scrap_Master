I am very happy with my product purchase, and I think I got a great deal, with a highly valuable product.

We looked at Mailchimp, Constant Contact, and others before selecting this software. It is very easy to use, templates make it fast to get started and your campaign looks very professional. it also allows us to set up groups to prioritize certain types of customers (Computers sales, Server Maintenance, RMM software)  to narrow down mass emails to very specifics qualifications. Scheduling is accurate and we love the analytics included in the system.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Brevo Marketing Platform?\nThe biggest downside is a very aggressive qualification process concerning importing emails. It did require several interactions with SendinBlue to get them to \"approve\" my list even though I was moving from another qualified source. I am sure it is for protection (We all hate Spammers!!)  but it can be a little frustrating.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Brevo Marketing Platform:\nI think this is the best option for SMB businesses getting started in this area of marketing. The feature set and pricing is much more in line with SMB than some of the other \"well known\" applications available.\n\nWhat problems is Brevo Marketing Platform solving and how is that benefiting you?\nCurrently, we are not experiencing any problems or issues with the software.

In the test that I have done with the free plan I could observe that the functionalities are quite complete and their automations are advanced in a well designed web page and with a control panel that will make you buy the program.\n\nI think it is the marketing tool with the most refined administration and best design. We can notice this in the register, one of the simplest that exist, the same happens within the platform, everything is made easy and comfortable. Another difference is that you don't have to limit your contacts, this is the first thing that restricts the email marketing tools.\n\nThe campaigns in SendinBlue are easy to carry out thanks to the excellent design of the main board, it is very simple and pleasant. With regard to the creation of Newsletters as most tools has a drag-and-drop editor that while very basic, can get you out of trouble when it comes to modifying things at the last minute. In this editor I have experienced slowness in the browser Chrome but I have managed to solve it by changing browser or closing tabs.\n\nThe customization has conditional content similar to those found in Excel, for this you must know how to program a little this type of logic in conditional attributes. The concept is well applied and allows the realization of a dynamic content that can discern between what kind of emails to send to each client based on their behavior and tastes. This is also found in the automation of emails where we can define certain parameters such as contact details, interaction with emails and ecommerce activity. In this it is remarkable that only SendinBlue allows to send confirmations and receipts of purchase through SMTP.\n\nThe forms are advanced and you can customize them a lot, for example it is good to add Captcha verifications and pre-fill fields with the data of your customers when you send them forms through email with SendinBlue. Available in 5 languages and with a section of Reports and Analysis that does not need improvement at the moment because you can integrate it with Google Analytics. You can not ask for more features that you can get for free.\n\nFinally it is important to note that Premium plans have a landing page editor very complete, stylish and robust. For this you must pay, the templates are nice and there are many to choose. I recommend to create them from scratch as well.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Brevo Marketing Platform?\nThe big problem with SendinBlue is deliverability. The rates are bad and many emails end up in the spam folder of the big mail providers.

This led to a lot of wasted time, and frustration, trying to test and execute different Automation Workflows, as you couldn't rely on the interface or platform response as accurately reflecting the current state of your users within the workflow.\n\nAdditionally with the Automation features, I tried for several hours to kick-off an automation to a list of contact I was importing via CSV. Between importing the users, copying or moving them from one list to another, triggering events for each user individually (which needed programmer intervention to make happen), I could not get the automation to start for pre-existing users. This is a major problem as we're testing migrating from a different platform and already have a list segment that we wanted to try out this Automation platform with.\n\nMoving on to the API, the \"standard\" API (that manages Campaigns, Lists, and Users) seems to be managed completely separately from the Automation API. There are different API keys for both, and different server-side API libraries for both. This makes the platform feel incredibly amateur and poorly integrated from a user's perspective.\n\nFurthermore, the documentation for the API leaves a lot to be desired. There are rudimentary examples for each endpoint with little explanation and description for each. The primary language of the documentation author(s) is obviously not english, which makes the documentation that much more difficult to understand and refer to. There is no technical level of documentation on the API, which makes it very hard to write integration code to really make the most of your lists.\n\nRegarding the Campaign features, there is a *ton* of confusion everywhere in the platform with scheduling. There is no indication of which timezone any of the timestamps are reported in, other than the setting to configure your own timezone for your account. Unfortunately, there is no prompt or notification for you to set your own timezone, and you just have to find it on your own. This causes major issues with campaign scheduling and deliverability, and it's really tough to discern whether a campaign failed to send due to a scheduling timezone issue, or a platform stability issue (see delays mentioned above).\n\nLastly, the entire user interface is incredibly confusing and clunky. The Automation Workflow configuration is about the only interface that is intuitive, but it still needs a lot of improvement. For a platform that claims to be as prestigious, reliable, and stable as Sendinblue does, they clearly do not prioritize user interface design or working to improve the learning curve required to help their users make the most out of their platform by investing in the user interface.\n\nThe features that are offered by Sendinblue are definitely top-notch. Unfortunately, however, the execution of those features is very poor, which makes them, in my own opinion, a middle of the road platform. There are many other options available that may not offer the same feature parity of Sendinblue, but the features they do offer are rock solid and the support they offer is top notch.\n\nUnfortunately, I absolutely can not recommend Sendinblue as a first-choice for sending emails. I wish that wasn't the case, as I really wanted to like their platform and tried to champion it, and work around the shortcomings.
