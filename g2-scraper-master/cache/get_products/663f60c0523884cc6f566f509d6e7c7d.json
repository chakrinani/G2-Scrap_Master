best about GetResponse MAX?\nOur company has been using GetResponse MAX for almost 5 years now both by the marketing team for customer newsletters and by the PR team for press releases. Although the latter might not be the intended use-case, it has served us well for both. The drag-and-drop editor and list management are easy to get into even for colleagues who haven't worked with GetResponse before and don't know HTML to code their own emails, while the list management and automated mailings in particular allow for some powerful features like sending specific emails to specific customers based on any relevant critera. You have to dig a bit deeper to fully grasp those more advanced features as they are not always as intuitive as the more surface-level features, but once you get the hang of it, I've yet to find a workflow I couldn't realise.\nIn those 5 years, we had only one major problem where our emails weren't delivered to a larger number of recipients, but their support team was quick to respond and fix this issue, so I won't hold that against them.\nNote that the MAX platform includes many more features like embeddable chats, automated SMS replies, Webinars, and more. We haven't used those either because they don't make sense for our business or we simpy didn't have the chance to try them yet, which is why I can comment only on the core features around mailings. Those, as outlined above, work great however, and I can highly recommend GetResponse for them.\n\nWhat do you dislike about GetResponse MAX?\nHonestly, besides the aforementioned deliverability problem that was quickly resolved, I've only ever found small nitpicks here and there. Things like for example not being able to set a default color for newly inserted buttons in the drag-and-drop editor, or some features being buried maybe one submenu too deep, making them not obvious and requiring a look into the documentation (which is fine, but could sometimes be a bit more in-depth), or moving to a different place after a redesign of the backend. None of that is a dealbreaker, though, and even here I've found our account managers to be quite responsive to feedback. The biggest letdown are probably A/B tests which wolrk fine, but are limited in their reportings and in their setup.\n\nWhat problems is GetResponse MAX solving and how is that benefiting you?\nAs mentioned before, we use it mainly for customer newsletters and press releases. We have a really engaged audience of subscribers, and GetResponse lets us create nice-looking emails, delivers them reliably, and - important for us as a European company - gives us all the tools to make sure we're GDPR compliant.", "review_question_answers": [{"question": "What do you like best about GetResponse MAX?", "answer": "Our company has been using GetResponse MAX for almost 5 years now both by the marketing team for customer newsletters and by the PR team for press releases.

Although the latter might not be the intended use-case, it has served us well for both. The drag-and-drop editor and list management are easy to get into even for colleagues who haven't worked with GetResponse before and don't know HTML to code their own emails, while the list management and automated mailings in particular allow for some powerful features like sending specific emails to specific customers based on any relevant critera. You have to dig a bit deeper to fully grasp those more advanced features as they are not always as intuitive as the more surface-level features, but once you get the hang of it, I've yet to find a workflow I couldn't realise.\nIn those 5 years, we had only one major problem where our emails weren't delivered to a larger number of recipients, but their support team was quick to respond and fix this issue, so I won't hold that against them.\nNote that the MAX platform includes many more features like embeddable chats, automated SMS replies, Webinars, and more. We haven't used those either because they don't make sense for our business or we simpy didn't have the chance to try them yet, which is why I can comment only on the core features around mailings. Those, as outlined above, work great however, and I can highly recommend GetResponse for them.\n\nWhat do you dislike about GetResponse MAX?\nHonestly, besides the aforementioned deliverability problem that was quickly resolved, I've only ever found small nitpicks here and there. Things like for example not being able to set a default color for newly inserted buttons in the drag-and-drop editor, or some features being buried maybe one submenu too deep, making them not obvious and requiring a look into the documentation (which is fine, but could sometimes be a bit more in-depth), or moving to a different place after a redesign of the backend. None of that is a dealbreaker, though, and even here I've found our account managers to be quite responsive to feedback.

The automation piece is very simple to understand and build. We have played around with the webinar feature, and it is very robust. It is designed specifically for webinars with mostly 1 speaker, and doesn't work well as a conference call type of class. But the very best thing about GetResponse is their instant customer service via chat. I will run into something that I can't figure out how to do, I pop open the chat window, and have my answer in a couple of minutes.\n\nWhat do you dislike about GetResponse MAX?\nSome things in the interface are not very intuitive. Like when I want to create an email as part of my automated campaign, and it's called a \"newsletter.\" But like I said above, the answers are only moments away with their chat support, so I can't complain. One of the things I really don't like is that when you remove a contact from one of your lists, it's gone.

The automation piece is very simple to understand and build. We have played around with the webinar feature, and it is very robust. It is designed specifically for webinars with mostly 1 speaker, and doesn't work well as a conference call type of class.
