It just works. Inbox 25 sends emails when they need to go out, and it tracks the data changes that happen in our system. Because Inbox25 runs on its own server, it doesn't rely upon the available processing power of SugarCRM to execute tasks. Thus, it can dependably sync 300,000+ leads and send out 40,000+ emails because it has a stable amount of dedicated computing resources. This is an enterprise-level production.\n\n2. Inbox25 Support = Helpful Engineers. Filing a support ticket puts you in touch with an engineer, and I was able to work directly with them to code logic hook augmentations to customize how SugarCRM sent their system data. Support is also on the ball and responds quickly. My ticket was answered at 9PM EST, fifteen minutes after I filed it.\n\n3. This vendor has it together. Everyone knows how to use their product effectively and how it works. They follow up on emails and check in on support tickets. They remember deadlines and they help you meet them. Inbox25 is a well-run company.\n\n4. Twilio Integration. Inbox25 has the best out-of-the-box Twilio integration for SugarCRM, and it is outstanding. Automating and tracking the returns of our SMS efforts has been a snap, and messages go out when they need to go out every single time.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Leadfwd?\nCannot yet specify time windows for SMS send as we can with email campaigns. However, I have been told thas feature is in development, and I believe it.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Leadfwd:\nIf you need a system that can process hundreds of thousands of leads, this is it.\n\nIf you're tired of traveling from vendor to vendor with a string of broken promises about data sync, welcome home.\n\nWhat problems is Leadfwd solving and how is that benefiting you?\nEmail and SMS Automation: We're still exploring all the ways we can add to the business logic we've already implemented for marketing.\n\nReliable Automatic Data Processing: Inbox25's SymSync feature is robust enough that we can perform lead routing, status changes, and task assignment in the Inbox25 portal, and it works every time.", "review_question_answers": [{"question": "What do you like best about Leadfwd?", "answer": "1.
