In my opinion Moengage unfortunately is one of those bad faith companies that make it extremely difficult to cancel your contract with them. But in a way that is way beyond the usual practices you can experience with subscription software. Not only do they not provide a way for you to cancel your subscription through their platform, they ignored 4 separate written attempts I made over 6 months to cancel our subscription repeatedly. This was when our business was experiencing financial difficulties and yet they continued to charge us money and refused to cancel the subscription in clear breach of their own terms of service. They ignored more than 10 emails I sent giving notice to terminate the contract, treated me with contempt when they did respond once and then went back to ignoring my emails, and then continued charging us thousands of dollars a quarter for a service we no longer wanted to use or were using. I tried changing our company bank details to prevent them from continuing to charge us and then they just used the old bank account details they had on file for us to continue to charge us money. It honestly is shocking to me that an established company with good reviews online has been this awful to deal with. I'm at a point where I'm disputing the charges with our bank and trying to block them from charging us in future via my bank, while they continue to completely ignore my cancellation attempts. To reiterate - we are totally within our rights to cancel the contract - there is nothing in there about fixed terms, and we gave more than the 30 days required notice. Keep in mind this is for a standard subscription contract that we are legally entitled to cancel by emailing them. So as one business owner to another, I advise you please do not to go with these guys and just pay a bit more for a reputable service that doesn't treat their customers this way. At a point when my business was struggling, it's been a kick in the pants that is just so avoidable if they would treat their customers as human beings and with the normal respect afforded to people.

They don't have an amazing admin user experience in terms of setting up flows to support re-engagement and retention, and this has a cost associated with it in terms of learning the tools and inefficiencies with setting things up quick and easily, but it is a solid tool that allows you to do a lot at a competitive price point.\n\nWhat do you dislike about MoEngage?\nI have had maybe the worst experience with Moengage that I've ever had as a customer during my 6 years running my business, to the point that I've lodged a formal complaint with the consumer watchdog in my country for what appears to be a breach of consumer and corporate law on their part. In my opinion Moengage unfortunately is one of those bad faith companies that make it extremely difficult to cancel your contract with them. But in a way that is way beyond the usual practices you can experience with subscription software. Not only do they not provide a way for you to cancel your subscription through their platform, they ignored 4 separate written attempts I made over 6 months to cancel our subscription repeatedly. This was when our business was experiencing financial difficulties and yet they continued to charge us money and refused to cancel the subscription in clear breach of their own terms of service. They ignored more than 10 emails I sent giving notice to terminate the contract, treated me with contempt when they did respond once and then went back to ignoring my emails, and then continued charging us thousands of dollars a quarter for a service we no longer wanted to use or were using. I tried changing our company bank details to prevent them from continuing to charge us and then they just used the old bank account details they had on file for us to continue to charge us money. It honestly is shocking to me that an established company with good reviews online has been this awful to deal with. I'm at a point where I'm disputing the charges with our bank and trying to block them from charging us in future via my bank, while they continue to completely ignore my cancellation attempts. To reiterate - we are totally within our rights to cancel the contract - there is nothing in there about fixed terms, and we gave more than the 30 days required notice. Keep in mind this is for a standard subscription contract that we are legally entitled to cancel by emailing them. So as one business owner to another, I advise you please do not to go with these guys and just pay a bit more for a reputable service that doesn't treat their customers this way. At a point when my business was struggling, it's been a kick in the pants that is just so avoidable if they would treat their customers as human beings and with the normal respect afforded to people. It honestly feels criminal to me at this point and has taken up hours of my time trying to resolve something that should be simple and straightforward. Bottom line - save yourself the trouble and please go with another provider.\n\nWhat problems is MoEngage solving and how is that benefiting you?\nWe needed an affordable system to send out automated push notifications for our mobile app product and also automated drip campaign emails that have a level of personalization when onboarding new users and re-engaging existing users.

So as one business owner to another, I advise you please do not to go with these guys and just pay a bit more for a reputable service that doesn't treat their customers this way. At a point when my business was struggling, it's been a kick in the pants that is just so avoidable if they would treat their customers as human beings and with the normal respect afforded to people. It honestly feels criminal to me at this point and has taken up hours of my time trying to resolve something that should be simple and straightforward. Bottom line - save yourself the trouble and please go with another provider."}, {"question": "What problems is MoEngage solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "We needed an affordable system to send out automated push notifications for our mobile app product and also automated drip campaign emails that have a level of personalization when onboarding new users and re-engaging existing users.
