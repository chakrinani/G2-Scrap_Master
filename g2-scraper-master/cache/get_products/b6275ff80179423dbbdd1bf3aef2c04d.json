Instead, you have all of the options/criteria/actions available to you, and you can speedily compile lists and campaigns. So once you know where everything is, you can really hum along without constant interruptions or multiple screens of setup.\n\nThe same UI components (for the list building criteria, for example) is the same/consistent in other parts of the application.  Like the reports builder or criteria for actions/triggers within campaigns.  So once you've learned it in one location, it is intuitive to use in other areas.\n\nData/contacts visibility and hygiene also seems easy, due to this setup.

Not being familiar with standard report designing, I found the flexibility overwhelming.  They've since re-vamped their entire reporting system, and it seems much more straight forward now - though, limiting.  I'm still not quite sure they've struck the perfect balance, but they sure are trying.\n\nI'll list out an industry standard 'dislike', but it's something I actually appreciate. DemandCenter's flow and UI design seems to boil down to speed, rather than guided walkthroughs and validation. Meaning, the system is flexible and doesn't stop you from performing invalid or mismatched actions. Sure, there are validation and testing mechanisms to test your final product, but it's not going to baby you through the setup or interrupt you with dialogs or page refreshes.

Know all of this before starting - even if you are planning on getting help via implementation services.\n\nWhat problems is eTrigue solving and how is that benefiting you?\nHuge ROI with the reduced man-hours required for this level of marketing automation.\n\nThe way DemandCenter has alerts set up is a huge bonus - though mostly a boon to the Sales department, and not so much marketing.  This tool perfectly blends both Sales and Marketing functionality.\n\nLast note: we're a software company that relies on trial downloads for lead generation. With the sheer volume, it would be easy to let leads slip through the cracks. But with DemandCenter, and tight use of automated campaigns, nothing slips through - all notifications go off as expected, automated nurturing keeps crunching away, and lead alerts/notifications keep firing off to the assigned rep.

To setup a campaign you just drag the action items to the dashboard, and rearrange the order if you change your mind. We can usually teach a new hire how to competently use eTrigue within a few hours. And they can setup their own campaign the same day.

We can usually setup a landing page, email, and follow on assets within a couple hours. Then test the campaign and have it live within 20 minutes. One thing that has helped us tremenously is that we dont have to create all of the emails and asssets before we start a campaign. With other tools we had to create all of the assets first, before we could build the campaign. In eTrigue, we can create the who campaign flow, and add assets as they are completed. We can even start the campaign when only the first asset is completed. This enables us to launch campaigns sooner and not lose time waiting for the asset to be completed.
