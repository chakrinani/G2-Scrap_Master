Overnight, without any big bang, they disabled some core parts of their platform, like \"forms\", \"email campaigns,\" and \"page creator\". What will switched of next? No one knows. You are now forced to use their \"500apps thing\", which is mostly in beta and rich of bugs (you can see them in the lower right corner on their dashboard). 500apps is a mish-mash of single apps collected in one platform. They are not interconnected  (if they are, tell me), they are loose... My opinion is that they are way too early to force their (longterm) clients to that childish platform, which is far away from \"production\". Now you have to use TWO platforms, with independend contacts lists (they are not in sync), \"forms\" , \"campaings\", and \"page creators\".

In AgileCRM all your contacts are extensively tagged and tracked, in AgileCRM you can see, when, how which client was contacted, subscribed, called.... At AgileCRM you are not able to create campaings in AgileCRM anymore. When you now try to create a new campaign for a specific target group, you have to export your target audience from AgileCRM into the 500bads... erm.. 500apps and create your campaingn there, with no ability to sync results back to AgileCRM. Are they got crazy? They are still offering things on their page, which are definitely not available anymore, they are simply shut down. It's really, really sad what they have done to themself and are still doing. You can watch how they destroy their state-of-the-art project to a stunted no-name project. No one knows why... I know the world is got crazy these times, but how can you do that AgileCRM?\n\nFor people searching for a mature project I highly suggest you to have a look to a more stable product like \"ActiveCampaign\", \"Zoho\", \"User.com\", \"sendinblue\", \"close.com\" or similar. Go and create your free account at AgileCRM and 500apps, but first read what they are offering on their Website and then try to find that features in the SaaS itself.

When you now try to create a new campaign for a specific target group, you have to export your target audience from AgileCRM into the 500bads... erm.. 500apps and create your campaingn there, with no ability to sync results back to AgileCRM. Are they got crazy? They are still offering things on their page, which are definitely not available anymore, they are simply shut down. It's really, really sad what they have done to themself and are still doing. You can watch how they destroy their state-of-the-art project to a stunted no-name project. No one knows why... I know the world is got crazy these times, but how can you do that AgileCRM?\n\nFor people searching for a mature project I highly suggest you to have a look to a more stable product like \"ActiveCampaign\", \"Zoho\", \"User.com\", \"sendinblue\", \"close.com\" or similar. Go and create your free account at AgileCRM and 500apps, but first read what they are offering on their Website and then try to find that features in the SaaS itself. Unbelievable, I still cannot get it.\n\nI will delete this post if AgileCRM is going back to \"normal\", but if not everyone should know what's happening there."}, {"question": "Recommendations to others considering Agile CRM:", "answer": "Be aware that they are migrating their customers from a mature product into a beta product, without warning you."}, {"question": "What problems is Agile CRM solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "OUTDATED, NOT TRUE ANYMORE: Full-service platform for CRM, Helpdesk, customer chat, call-center, Campaign management, pop-ups, Email forms, Customer care, and many more..."}], "review_rating": 1.5, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "Jan J.", "reviewer_job_title": "CEO, Developer, Product manager", "reviewer_link": "https://www.g2.com/users/252a83d6-93a1-4f9c-b065-09f0afc4647c"}, "publish_date": "2021-12-22T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Small-Business(50 or fewer emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/agile-crm/reviews/agile-crm-review-5223248"}, {"review_id": 5411943, "review_title": "Paid Version breaks and has many errors", "review_content": "What do you like best about Agile CRM?\nI start using AgileCRM because it felt flexible and had many features I wanted\n\nWhat do you dislike about Agile CRM?\nMostly that they don't let you go and keep on charging money when you want to stop the paid subscription.

about Agile CRM?\nWe used Agile CRM primarily for email marketing. Email marketing automations are very flexible. Flowchart oriented automations are easy to design. We found this capability to be significantly better than most of the email marketing tools we researched, including small business market leaders Constant Contact and MailChimp. This was the main reason we chose AgileCRM.\n\nContact management was very good...again, better than Constant Contact or MailChimp. It was easy to work with contacts and to sort and filter them in different ways.\n\nAPI was flexible and able to do all we needed to integrate with our user management system.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Agile CRM?\nEmail campaigns were not reliable. Too many instances of campaigns that we determined had not been sent as expected, only to hear from support \"Oh, that was our fault, it got bogged down in our server.\" We could not count on the campaigns just working all the time.\n\nSupport was only helpful at a superficial level. We could get help on some small problems, but on other problems, we would get replies like \"We have forwarded this to our executives and will be back in touch.\" But they would not get back in touch. Support didn't always seem to understand or even thoroughly read our requests. If a support request asked 4 questions, only 1 would be answered.\n\nSome features just didn't work in the ways you would hope or expect. For example, in an email drip campaign, there was no way to find out open rates on individual emails, only open rates on the campaign as a whole (if any email was opened, but not which ones).\n\nReporting was very limited. For example, you could not get any cross campaign reporting on contacts who had unsubscribed like \"Give me a list of all contacts who have unsubscribed with the list of campaigns they have unsubscribed from\". In looking at contact detail, you could not see which campaigns they had unsubscribed from. Reporting of other kinds was often frustrating and limited.\n\nEmail templates that were supposed to be responsive were only sort of responsive. We had lots of issues with emails that didn't look right on different browsers and devices. These are issues that we don't have with MailChimp (which we switched to). Also, designing emails was fairly cumbersome and frustrating. You have to choose Save in 2 to 3 places to actually get an email and a campaign to save. It was easy to lose your work if you weren't careful.\n\nThe user interface for campaign management was messy and didn't work as expected. It was very easy to wipe out all the data associated with a campaign if you tried to make a copy of a campaign. Several times, the process to make a copy and then save it wiped out the original campaign losing months of data that could not be recovered. Even after working with AgileCRM for 2 years, it was too easy to wipe things out by mistake and never be completely sure why it had happened.\n\nWhat problems is Agile CRM solving and how is that benefiting you?\nWe used AgileCRM for 2 years to handle all our email marketing. We were able to have some complex campaign automations that were relatively easy to build. We invested a fair amount of development time in building an integration with our user management system, so had a commitment to use AgileCRM. But ultimately, it was too unreliable for us to continue using it. We couldn't count on campaigns going on as expected and it threatened our business. Sadly, we had to duplicate the integration development work for another system so we could switch away from AgileCRM.

Is so easy to set up and very user-friendly. Just finished imported our Data from Zoho and all looks good. I have given up spending time in Zoho CRM that almost forces you to enroll in what I can only describe as a university course. Agile has some things that need improvement but the development team doesn't stop bringing out new features and tools and you can also post your development ideas into a Forum and this can be voted by other users, I have already something being developed using this tool. If you want something simple to use but also fool of cool features this is the system to go. I love the Chrome extension where you can add contacts on the go from any web page (including the great Linkedin fetch contact details feature).

Is so easy to set up and very user-friendly. Just finished imported our Data from Zoho and all looks good. I have given up spending time in Zoho CRM that almost forces you to enroll in what I can only describe as a university course. Agile has some things that need improvement but the development team doesn't stop bringing out new features and tools and you can also post your development ideas into a Forum and this can be voted by other users, I have already something being developed using this tool. If you want something simple to use but also fool of cool features this is the system to go.

For a non-technical personal, there has been a learning curve, but everyday I'm getting better.

When you ask for an email to be traced so you can see when it is opened by a contact, it continues to register as opening over and over every time the email MOVES in their email cue. That results in many multiple duplicate reports in the timeline that the email was opened, which cannot be deleted. That plugs up the timeline and is super annoying. It is also not possible to connect a document to a contact without having to redownload it every time you want to view it, so I just decided not to attach documents to contacts. It was one of the main functions I wanted...to easily see my quotes for each contact, but this is a very time consuming and clunky process. I was disappointed when I was notified (even though I am sure this is shown someplace in the copy about the different membership levels) that you only get 5 campaigns in the lowest level of service and adding another user doesn't give them any more new campaigns.

The feature I find most useful for our company would be the drag and drop campaign builder.

It seems they spend so much time adding bells and whistles that they never improve on the core functionality of the software. At this point they've added email sending, helpdesk ticketing and other branch out parts, where they just may have been better off integrating with other systems and strengthening the core CRM.  The system frequently times out when I am using it, the search option often gets hung up, and the connections between the compartments of the software and confusing and easy to mess up- just to name a few.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Agile CRM:\nWhen choosing Agile CRM, I would highly recommend talking to someone at the company for a demo and starting with a free trial. There is a lot of good about Agile CRM, including a variety of API integrations as well as a lot of useful features, however the sheer amount of options and add-ons can make the software tough to use. The support for Agile can also be challanging to work with, and I've find the vast majority of times I've needed help immediately, my options were to schedule a chat for some other time or submit an email that takes up to 24 hours to receive a response.  The help videos also weren't that helpful for me, so there was a lot of trial and error. At one point, when creating a campaign,  the system started sending the same email repeatedly to the same 20 clients, I couldn't find anyone to help and had to scrap my entire days work. There also are some odd quirks, like the cancel button on the email creation being more prominent than the send, and the system randomly closing my session and needing a verification code to log back in.

I enjoy the simple, yet powerful interface. I also like how it integrates seamlessly to GMail; we are able to quickly add, from GMail, contact information into AgileCRM.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Agile CRM?\nI do not like how it handles email and social alerts. I would like AgileCRM to be able to operate almost as an email client; allowing us to see all incoming customer/prospect emails in one location (I submitted this as a feature request some time ago). I also do not like the fact that AgileCRM will \"lose\" emails if they are deleted from my email client; it should be able to preserve past emails whether they were deleted from GMail or not. Alerts are top priority...email, social, etc.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Agile CRM:\nAgile is a very effective CRM system for small business.

You can easily add custom fields, but the interface is basic so I wouldn't recommend it from a visual perspective.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Agile CRM?\nFor the CRM portion, the information is stored in tabs. So if you want to look at a contact record, you can tab to see their info, then tab to see their web activity, then tab to see their campaigns - it does not live on one page.\n\nThe email automation and emailing are a nightmare. You can't put an unsubscribe link in an email template - you have to add the field to each email you send, both one off and in a campaign. In text versions of the email, you can not add links. You also cannot set account wide lead scoring for things like demographic data - you have to add that to every campaign, and a demographic node counts as one, and then the score node counts as one  - campaigns are limited by the amount of nodes, so you can pretty much set up one or two emails in a single campaign before you have to transfer them to a new campaign. Also, once the campaign is running, you cannot make any changes to the email.

You can easily add custom fields, but the interface is basic so I wouldn't recommend it from a visual perspective."}, {"question": "What do you dislike about Agile CRM?", "answer": "For the CRM portion, the information is stored in tabs. So if you want to look at a contact record, you can tab to see their info, then tab to see their web activity, then tab to see their campaigns - it does not live on one page.\n\nThe email automation and emailing are a nightmare. You can't put an unsubscribe link in an email template - you have to add the field to each email you send, both one off and in a campaign. In text versions of the email, you can not add links. You also cannot set account wide lead scoring for things like demographic data - you have to add that to every campaign, and a demographic node counts as one, and then the score node counts as one  - campaigns are limited by the amount of nodes, so you can pretty much set up one or two emails in a single campaign before you have to transfer them to a new campaign. Also, once the campaign is running, you cannot make any changes to the email.
