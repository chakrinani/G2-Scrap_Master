We are a global company and offer 12 languages, if we wanted to format emails properly per language and send them to the whole world, that would end up being 36 total marketing campaigns.  We would need to report on those 36 campaigns individually, even though it would actually be one campaign.  This is extra difficult because there is no report builder to report on multiple emails at once, which is problematic for us because we have to send three campaigns for each campaign so that they send at semi appropriate times (because there is no feature allowing us to send emails in the user's time zone).\n\nRecommendations to others considering MessageGears Platform:\nMessageGears is a useful product that is cost effective.  Its localization options are limited and that is the main drawback.  Not being able to deliver emails in a user's time zone, and not being able to localize formatting and links for different regions or languages easily are our biggest pain points.\n\nWhat problems is MessageGears Platform solving and how is that benefiting you?\nWe use MessageGears to email the user base for one of our fitness apps.
