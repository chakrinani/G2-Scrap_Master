As an end-to-end HubSpot user, we're able to pull in signals into our HubSpot dashboards, powering both sales and marketing to be on the same page on who we're targeting and when. From a marketers perspective, Rollworks makes it pretty easy to build playbooks and audiences to target.\n\nWhat do you dislike about RollWorks Account-Based Platform?\nI wish we could upload our own HTML5 ads. I understand why we can't but sometimes that adds a few days to the timeline, waiting for those to be populated.\n\nWhat problems is RollWorks Account-Based Platform solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThe biggest issue RollWorks solved for me was that it tells us where to fish and when to fish there.

As a marketer striving to drive targeted engagement and personalized experiences for my target accounts, I have found RollWorks to be an invaluable tool in achieving my goals. Here's what I like best about this exceptional platform:\n\nComprehensive Account-Based Capabilities:\nRollWorks offers a comprehensive suite of features specifically tailored for account-based marketing. From identifying and targeting key accounts to executing multi-channel campaigns, the platform covers the entire ABM workflow. It allows me to easily segment and prioritize accounts, create personalized campaigns, and measure their effectiveness, all within a single interface.\n\nPrecise Account Identification:\nRollWorks excels in its ability to identify and prioritize high-value accounts accurately. The platform leverages powerful data analytics and machine learning algorithms to provide actionable insights about potential customers. The account identification process is highly sophisticated, taking into account firmographics, technographics, intent data, and historical engagement to ensure I'm targeting the right accounts with the highest propensity to convert.\n\nMultichannel Orchestration:\nOne of the standout features of RollWorks is its seamless integration of various marketing channels. The platform enables me to deliver a consistent and personalized experience across multiple touchpoints, including display advertising, email marketing, social media, and more. The ability to orchestrate campaigns across channels not only increases the reach but also enhances engagement and conversion rates by ensuring a cohesive brand presence.\n\nAdvanced Personalization:\nRollWorks empowers me to create highly personalized campaigns that resonate with target accounts on an individual level.

I highly recommend RollWorks to any organization looking to take their ABM efforts to new heights.\n\nWhat do you dislike about RollWorks Account-Based Platform?\nLearning Curve: RollWorks Account-Based Platform is a powerful tool with advanced capabilities, which can result in a slightly steep learning curve for new users. While the platform provides documentation and resources to support onboarding, some individuals may require additional time and effort to fully grasp and utilize all the features effectively.\n\nComplexity for Small-Scale Operations: The robustness of RollWorks can be a double-edged sword for smaller-scale operations. While the platform is ideal for enterprises and larger organizations with significant resources, it may seem overwhelming or unnecessary for smaller businesses with limited budgets and simpler ABM requirements. Simplifying the user interface or offering scaled-down versions tailored to smaller businesses could address this concern.\n\nIntegration Challenges: While RollWorks offers integrations with various marketing automation and CRM platforms, some users may encounter challenges when integrating the platform with their existing tech stack. Depending on the specific systems and configurations, the integration process might require technical expertise or additional support from RollWorks' team to ensure smooth data flow and synchronization.\n\nPricing Structure: The pricing structure for RollWorks Account-Based Platform may be considered a drawback by some users. The platform operates on a subscription-based model, and the costs can be relatively higher compared to other ABM solutions in the market. This pricing structure may restrict access for smaller businesses or those with limited marketing budgets, potentially limiting their ability to leverage the platform's full potential.\n\nLimited Native Advertising Options: While RollWorks provides robust multichannel capabilities, some users might find the native advertising options within the platform to be limited. Expanding the range of native advertising channels and ad formats would enhance the platform's versatility and enable users to leverage additional channels for their ABM campaigns.\n\nWhat problems is RollWorks Account-Based Platform solving and how is that benefiting you?\nRollWorks Account-Based Platform solves several critical problems in the realm of account-based marketing (ABM), which ultimately benefit me as a marketer.

I also love the ability to target ads based on journey stage. Our target audience is US hospitals with a few additional parameters, so our account targets are very precise. An ABM platform is the best way for us to reach that audience. I've onboarded RollWorks twice, and the onboarding teams have both been great at getting us up and running.

Of all of the platforms we use for lead generation, Rollworks is in last place. In 8 months, RollWorks hasn't generated a single download of a piece of content from our website (we're only asking for an email in return.)

One example is that in a playbook, there may be twice as many Accounts Reached as Accounts Targeted. Who are we reaching, then, if they're not part of our Targets? We've been waiting for an answer to that question for 10 weeks. Another example is that an account will appear as 'not targeted' in a trending account report, but show that it's included in a specific account targeting playbook.

You have several options to drill down and review your data as well. You can setup detailed reports to run on a schedule and email you once a week/month/etc. on ad performance, conversions, impressions, etc. But what I really appreciate is the journey funnel view. This breaks down each target account list into three main categories: unaware, aware, engaged. Here you can get a quick glance at how many accounts are in each category.

Rollworks is fantastic about asking their customers what features they'd like to see and it seems about every 6 months they have new updates to roll out.\n\nThe only downfall is that you can only have one set of intent topics, and for a company that has several services with very different intent signals, this means we can only have one campaign setup with intent topics at a time.\n\nRecommendations to others considering RollWorks Account-Based Platform:\nHave a good understanding of the ABM program you want to run before purchasing any software, this will help you with your onboarding and setting up proper goals to measure success.\n\nWhat problems is RollWorks Account-Based Platform solving and how is that benefiting you?\nRollworks has helped us target new accounts and start building brand awareness with a wider audience, but they also help us nurture sales prospects through the sales pipeline.

You have several options to drill down and review your data as well. You can setup detailed reports to run on a schedule and email you once a week/month/etc. on ad performance, conversions, impressions, etc. But what I really appreciate is the journey funnel view. This breaks down each target account list into three main categories: unaware, aware, engaged. Here you can get a quick glance at how many accounts are in each category.

His calm demeanor and expertise in all of the workings, programs, options, reports, and even integrated tools (like SFDC) are extremely helpful. Brandon has made himself extremely accessible to me. I have called upon him many times in the past, sometimes 2 to 3 times a week, with questions or virtual meetings. Being new to this tool, he has displayed incredible patience with me.

The options therein empower the user to have a much farther reach of Brand Awareness and marketing than just doing things manually or the old-fashioned way.\n- Once you learn how to navigate the GUI, and understand how they organize things, it's straightforward to be able to implement campaigns at both the account level, and the contact level.\n- The programming of campaign management is very easy to keep track of. You have everything you need all in one place.\n- One of my favorite parts is being able to measure at the account level, and not just the contact level.\n- And my favorite part...They make measuring performance very easy.\n\nWhat do you dislike about RollWorks Account-Based Platform?\nI wish Brandon was local.

He or She can help you navigate the tool, and if you tell them your objectives, they can tell you how to get what you need done, and perhaps even help you optimize your overall strategies!

Note that I only use Growlabs as a lead intelligence tool, not for outreach. In the test, Growlabs had on average 57% more perfect quality leads than the next leading competitor, when controlled for industries, geography, job titles, and field availability, for leads that are Director-grade and up. This means that in my test, all platforms had an equal and fair chance. Growlabs blew the rest out of the water in terms of being able to find accurate information for leads that are Director-level, VP-level, C-level, SVP/EVP, Partner, Owner, or President. I think this is because of the variety of sources it gathers information from. If you are going to buy some other system, Growlabs probably already sources from it. That amount of information, cross-referenced and verified in the ever-growing Growlabs database, results in an average of 57% more perfect quality leads than any other system can offer. If you email me at josh@factoryfour.com, I can even share my study with you.\n\nWhat do you dislike about RollWorks Account-Based Platform?\nI don't like how you can't search for companies (or \"accounts\") - you can only search for leads. With an Account-Based Marketing strategy (ABM), we would like to be able to search for ideal companies first, then choose leads from those companies. Growlabs only lets you search for leads though. Our current workaround is to search for companies in LinkedIn Sales Navigator, then put their web addresses into an Excel sheet, then upload that sheet to Growlabs and it find the leads at those companies. This process takes me about 30 minutes every time I go to make a lead list, but it's well worth it because of the drastically greater high quality lead volume I get from Growlabs versus other systems that let you search by company.\n\nRecommendations to others considering RollWorks Account-Based Platform:\nBefore choosing a lead intel platform, whether on a free trial or a live demo, run a test across the different target audiences that you will be engaging and see which platform gives you the highest number of high quality, verified leads in each segment. That is the only true test of such a platform, and a very simple one to perform. If you get any pushback, then the company is clearly worried about their data quality.\n\nWhat problems is RollWorks Account-Based Platform solving and how is that benefiting you?\nGrowlabs helps me automate the process of gathering lead intelligence. Using Growlabs, I have completely automated what I used to spend 4 days a week doing. I now spend about 30 minutes a week doing it.", "review_question_answers": [{"question": "What do you like best about RollWorks Account-Based Platform?", "answer": "I did a test of Growlabs versus all other lead intelligence platforms.

That amount of information, cross-referenced and verified in the ever-growing Growlabs database, results in an average of 57% more perfect quality leads than any other system can offer. If you email me at josh@factoryfour.com, I can even share my study with you."}, {"question": "What do you dislike about RollWorks Account-Based Platform?", "answer": "I don't like how you can't search for companies (or \"accounts\") - you can only search for leads. With an Account-Based Marketing strategy (ABM), we would like to be able to search for ideal companies first, then choose leads from those companies. Growlabs only lets you search for leads though. Our current workaround is to search for companies in LinkedIn Sales Navigator, then put their web addresses into an Excel sheet, then upload that sheet to Growlabs and it find the leads at those companies. This process takes me about 30 minutes every time I go to make a lead list, but it's well worth it because of the drastically greater high quality lead volume I get from Growlabs versus other systems that let you search by company."}, {"question": "Recommendations to others considering RollWorks Account-Based Platform:", "answer": "Before choosing a lead intel platform, whether on a free trial or a live demo, run a test across the different target audiences that you will be engaging and see which platform gives you the highest number of high quality, verified leads in each segment. That is the only true test of such a platform, and a very simple one to perform. If you get any pushback, then the company is clearly worried about their data quality."}, {"question": "What problems is RollWorks Account-Based Platform solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "Growlabs helps me automate the process of gathering lead intelligence. Using Growlabs, I have completely automated what I used to spend 4 days a week doing.
