This has been especially appreciated during the turbulent uncertainty created by Covid. In the short time that we've been using Actito, the visual presentation of our emails has improved, and the process of creating our campaigns is much easier and less time-consuming. We've continued with our previous email strategies, along with implementing new ones because of Covid, and have been able to achieve some business goals that had been on our priority list for some time. In addition, the Actito staff we have worked with have been very supportive and helpful.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Actito?\nThis is a specific and minor issue, but it seems it is not possible to update a message that is connected to a scenario, so if you need to make changes to a message in a scenario, you must duplicate the message, make your changes, save it as a new message, and then end the current scenario, duplicate it, connect it to the new message, save it as a new scenario, and then start the new scenario. I would love it if it was possible to just update the message itself and keep the scenario running with that updated message without have to take all the above-mentioned steps.\n\nWhat problems is Actito solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThroughout the last year, we have needed to send more frequent updates to customers; Actito has allowed us to be able to quickly and efficiently do this.
