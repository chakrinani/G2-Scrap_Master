The learning curve is not that steep if you already have experiecne with other platforms, and as a daily user, i feel it was a fairly quick process to fall into a routine.  Implemtnation / Integration  is fairly simple when using qualified CRM experts. Things i like most are being able to see who clicked and opened isntead of constantly having to query for it. Many of the reviews i've seen are comparing apples to oranges, mainly because the CD ecoystem is all inclusive, whereasother platforms requrie that you switch from here to see this, and then over to here to see that. CD provides a single ecosystem that directly accesses your CRM. The CSMs and the Support team ar etop notch, very repsonsive and proactive in helping.  I'd say the biggest positive is with value. Sure there are better platforms, and there are cheaper platforms, but the value of each are no where near the value provided at this price point.\n\nWhat do you dislike about ClickDimensions?\nLimitations in the Social media area, UX needs to be updated to be more modern, but it still passes the eye test. Would love to see more ability to customize things out of the box, rather than require coders and/or other experts to fully achieve my most desired functionality. There is no simple way to add pop-ups to a website, but again, if you have the expertise on HTML/CSS or have the resources, it isn't a heavy lift. There is often some nuances that can only be learned the hard way or with in-depth training from someone with extensive experience on the platform.\n\nWhat problems is ClickDimensions solving and how is that benefiting you?\nIn today's world, having a \"tech stack\" is almost unavoidable. Having to go from one platform to another, to another, and so on is par for the course, but having a single platform that reduces a lot fo the back and forth and integrates web, email, NPS surveys with responses, and much more that is readily avaiable in the CRM increases productivity, reduces the back and forth and confusion of \"dang, where was i...what was i doing befor ei had to switch to this that and the other...\".

The learning curve is not that steep if you already have experiecne with other platforms, and as a daily user, i feel it was a fairly quick process to fall into a routine.  Implemtnation / Integration  is fairly simple when using qualified CRM experts. Things i like most are being able to see who clicked and opened isntead of constantly having to query for it. Many of the reviews i've seen are comparing apples to oranges, mainly because the CD ecoystem is all inclusive, whereasother platforms requrie that you switch from here to see this, and then over to here to see that. CD provides a single ecosystem that directly accesses your CRM. The CSMs and the Support team ar etop notch, very repsonsive and proactive in helping.  I'd say the biggest positive is with value. Sure there are better platforms, and there are cheaper platforms, but the value of each are no where near the value provided at this price point.\n\nWhat do you dislike about ClickDimensions?\nLimitations in the Social media area, UX needs to be updated to be more modern, but it still passes the eye test. Would love to see more ability to customize things out of the box, rather than require coders and/or other experts to fully achieve my most desired functionality. There is no simple way to add pop-ups to a website, but again, if you have the expertise on HTML/CSS or have the resources, it isn't a heavy lift. There is often some nuances that can only be learned the hard way or with in-depth training from someone with extensive experience on the platform.\n\nWhat problems is ClickDimensions solving and how is that benefiting you?\nIn today's world, having a \"tech stack\" is almost unavoidable. Having to go from one platform to another, to another, and so on is par for the course, but having a single platform that reduces a lot fo the back and forth and integrates web, email, NPS surveys with responses, and much more that is readily avaiable in the CRM increases productivity, reduces the back and forth and confusion of \"dang, where was i...what was i doing befor ei had to switch to this that and the other...\".

CD provides a single ecosystem that directly accesses your CRM. The CSMs and the Support team ar etop notch, very repsonsive and proactive in helping.  I'd say the biggest positive is with value. Sure there are better platforms, and there are cheaper platforms, but the value of each are no where near the value provided at this price point."}, {"question": "What do you dislike about ClickDimensions?", "answer": "Limitations in the Social media area, UX needs to be updated to be more modern, but it still passes the eye test. Would love to see more ability to customize things out of the box, rather than require coders and/or other experts to fully achieve my most desired functionality. There is no simple way to add pop-ups to a website, but again, if you have the expertise on HTML/CSS or have the resources, it isn't a heavy lift. There is often some nuances that can only be learned the hard way or with in-depth training from someone with extensive experience on the platform."}, {"question": "What problems is ClickDimensions solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "In today's world, having a \"tech stack\" is almost unavoidable. Having to go from one platform to another, to another, and so on is par for the course, but having a single platform that reduces a lot fo the back and forth and integrates web, email, NPS surveys with responses, and much more that is readily avaiable in the CRM increases productivity, reduces the back and forth and confusion of \"dang, where was i...what was i doing befor ei had to switch to this that and the other...\". I love that the ecosystem provides all of this visiblity, meanwhile i am able to automate a lot of my campaigns (set it and forget it) and focus mor eon reporting."}], "review_rating": 4.5, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "Rickey J.", "reviewer_job_title": "Customer Success Manager", "reviewer_link": "https://www.g2.com/users/63fc0555-c434-4646-976f-fa078f5ecf2c"}, "publish_date": "2024-06-06T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Mid-Market(51-1000 emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/clickdimensions/reviews/clickdimensions-review-9758321"}, {"review_id": 9144581, "review_title": "Robust Marketing Engine", "review_content": "What do you like best about ClickDimensions?\nI like using ClickDimensions because it integrates with Microsoft Dynamics which is our current CRM.

The turnaround time is hours or days between a support agent asking us for information (which we provide immediately) and them getting back to us with anything other than speculation that the issue is not on our side (we must've broken something). On two issues, we discovered that our problems were due to a fault on their side (to which we have zero exposure), and both times, it was like pulling teeth to get any acknowledgement. Almost all of our other support experiences have been equally unsatisfying ... some were even closed without resolution/explanation. Once or twice, we had a good support experience out of about 20 I can recall. Very little accountability. My CSM even criticized my use of 'CDI' in reference to ClickDimensions ... said that was 'confusing' even though that's what many customers and CDI employees refer to it in text. Also, Email Statistics were BROKEN for years and still have issues. Issues are less frequent now, but getting them resolved is a real chore, because each and every time, we need to basically argue with their techs that the issue is not our 'fault' but rather on the CDI side in most cases. Our data is in a \"black box\" on the CDI side, and they often fail to deliver or provide explanation, even upon explicit request.\n\nFull disclosure: We did once have an 'issue' that was purely our own fault, and we did press them a bit as if it were a CDI problem. I apologized profusely.\n\nRecommendations to others considering ClickDimensions:\nIt needs time to more fully mature; although, it is much better today than it was a year ago.

The turnaround time is hours or days between a support agent asking us for information (which we provide immediately) and them getting back to us with anything other than speculation that the issue is not on our side (we must've broken something). On two issues, we discovered that our problems were due to a fault on their side (to which we have zero exposure), and both times, it was like pulling teeth to get any acknowledgement. Almost all of our other support experiences have been equally unsatisfying ... some were even closed without resolution/explanation. Once or twice, we had a good support experience out of about 20 I can recall. Very little accountability. My CSM even criticized my use of 'CDI' in reference to ClickDimensions ... said that was 'confusing' even though that's what many customers and CDI employees refer to it in text. Also, Email Statistics were BROKEN for years and still have issues. Issues are less frequent now, but getting them resolved is a real chore, because each and every time, we need to basically argue with their techs that the issue is not our 'fault' but rather on the CDI side in most cases. Our data is in a \"black box\" on the CDI side, and they often fail to deliver or provide explanation, even upon explicit request.\n\nFull disclosure: We did once have an 'issue' that was purely our own fault, and we did press them a bit as if it were a CDI problem.

(I realise this is a big ask)"}, {"question": "Recommendations to others considering ClickDimensions:", "answer": "Id recommend that you select the right partner to help you implement this product or you do some good learning within Dynamics 365 that wil help you leverage the true capabilities of ClickD. The product is amazing and when correctly implemented and integrated with the right Dynamics 365 functionality, MASSIVE and AMAZING things will happen!"}, {"question": "What problems is ClickDimensions solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "MANY.... We have used Click D across multiple verticals and in multiple businesses to solve a host of problems all the way from emailing out \"Email Invoices\" to transactional customers to bulk mailing massive marketing lists, tracking web interactions and document downloads (don't ask). Click D has amazing capabilities but is menat to act as a base for marketing automation. The out the box solution is amazing but once Dynamics 365 is configured correctly around the marketing automation functionality, the most amazing things can be unlocked and achieved."}], "review_rating": 5.0, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "Chris H.", "reviewer_job_title": "Dynamics CRM Presales", "reviewer_link": "https://www.g2.com/users/89bcea5e-5c3e-4cc3-8bbc-991a0a9efc39"}, "publish_date": "2017-06-07T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Mid-Market(51-1000 emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/clickdimensions/reviews/clickdimensions-review-306034"}, {"review_id": 305532, "review_title": "Best CRM marketing integration with Dynamics", "review_content": "What do you like best about ClickDimensions?\nThe integration with dynamics is 110%, so all the data is flowing through our CRM, so we can take decisions from that data.\nThe facility to install and configure, as well as the ease of use at the first steps.\n\nWhat do you dislike about ClickDimensions?\nThe way to personalise the forms and i dislike that in marketing automation we cannot access to custom entities (only if you build a CRM workflow). neither in forms or surveys, clickdimensions Out of the Box work with Accounts, Leads, Contacts\n\nRecommendations to others considering ClickDimensions:\nClickdimensions will help you with the marketing of your business integrating all the data in Dynamics 365, this data is shared with other departments so they are aware in every moment what marketing and trade so there is a better communication among all the departments\n\nWhat problems is ClickDimensions solving and how is that benefiting you?\nClickdimensions solves the problems with the intergation with Dynamics 365 as occur with other platforms as Hubspot.\nAll the email marketing is done with Clickdimesions, so we have the tracking of all the emails visits, etc, so we can take decisions regarding this data", "review_question_answers": [{"question": "What do you like best about ClickDimensions?", "answer": "The integration with dynamics is 110%, so all the data is flowing through our CRM, so we can take decisions from that data.\nThe facility to install and configure, as well as the ease of use at the first steps."}, {"question": "What do you dislike about ClickDimensions?", "answer": "The way to personalise the forms and i dislike that in marketing automation we cannot access to custom entities (only if you build a CRM workflow). neither in forms or surveys, clickdimensions Out of the Box work with Accounts, Leads, Contacts"}, {"question": "Recommendations to others considering ClickDimensions:", "answer": "Clickdimensions will help you with the marketing of your business integrating all the data in Dynamics 365, this data is shared with other departments so they are aware in every moment what marketing and trade so there is a better communication among all the departments"}, {"question": "What problems is ClickDimensions solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "Clickdimensions solves the problems with the intergation with Dynamics 365 as occur with other platforms as Hubspot.\nAll the email marketing is done with Clickdimesions, so we have the tracking of all the emails visits, etc, so we can take decisions regarding this data"}], "review_rating": 4.5, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "Ignacio D.", "reviewer_job_title": "Marketing Technology Consultant", "reviewer_link": "https://www.g2.com/users/fcd3b3fc-d72a-4131-88c9-1c64437bd29a"}, "publish_date": "2017-06-07T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Mid-Market(51-1000 emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/clickdimensions/reviews/clickdimensions-review-305532"}, {"review_id": 305081, "review_title": "Love this tool ", "review_content": "What do you like best about ClickDimensions?\nI love that the CilckDimensions tool is fully integrated with Dynamics 365.
