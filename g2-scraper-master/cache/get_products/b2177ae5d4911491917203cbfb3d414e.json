Do you need an accounting application? You have Zoho books, invoice, expense, inventory, subscription. You have Zoho CRM to maintain your leads and customers. There are Zoho campaigns and marketing hub for your marketing team. Zoho Analytics for BI and business analytics to make dashboards and reports. The best part is that all these applications come tightly integrated, i.e, you do not have to pass data between these applications manually; it'll all happen automatically in the background.

This was not clear until we asked someone why the Zoho Forms we had integrated in the MarketingHub Lead Gen tool weren't working to give our prospects scores. Additionally, the emails send through Zoho are going to spam more often than our emails from other email campaign  building services. This includes emails being sent to staff members.
