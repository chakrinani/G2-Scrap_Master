Our salesperson, Lori Grass was thorough in assessing our needs and made sure she understood our goals and challenges before giving us a customized proposal.  She hit the perfect balance of moving us along in the sales cycle while patiently addressing our questions and concerns.\n\nWe spent a month carefully comparing ROI to several other providers of marketing automation software and chose ROI based on two main factors: flexibility and service.\n\nThe other providers had standardized products with little ability or willingness to be flexible to address our particular needs.  We would be required to fit into their system with little customization possible.\n\nWhen we read the reviews of the different products on G2crowd.com, the comments consistently touted ROI's strong focus on providing fast, attentive customer service.  We have found this to be true in our six months with them.  Most small/medium issues are addressed the same day and we receive communication if an issue will take more than 24 hours to be resolved.\n\nOnce we signed the contract, we were passed to the onboarding team who immediately scheduled with us.  I'm sure many have experienced the frustration of being put on a lengthy hold once the ink was dry.  This was not the case here.  We were scheduled to pass the information needed to setup our account the following week.\n\nWe got a good example of the personalized service offered when our unique configuration warranted the attention of Amol Dalvi, the CTO of the company.  I am doubtful that any of the other marketing automation companies we reviewed would have devoted the time of their chief technology officer to our unique needs.\n\nOnce we became familiar with the basic functions of the software, we were referred to the customer success team to help us plan how to get the most out of our purchase.

Our salesperson, Lori Grass was thorough in assessing our needs and made sure she understood our goals and challenges before giving us a customized proposal.  She hit the perfect balance of moving us along in the sales cycle while patiently addressing our questions and concerns.\n\nWe spent a month carefully comparing ROI to several other providers of marketing automation software and chose ROI based on two main factors: flexibility and service.\n\nThe other providers had standardized products with little ability or willingness to be flexible to address our particular needs.  We would be required to fit into their system with little customization possible.\n\nWhen we read the reviews of the different products on G2crowd.com, the comments consistently touted ROI's strong focus on providing fast, attentive customer service.  We have found this to be true in our six months with them.  Most small/medium issues are addressed the same day and we receive communication if an issue will take more than 24 hours to be resolved.\n\nOnce we signed the contract, we were passed to the onboarding team who immediately scheduled with us.

This is not simply a marketing automation platform; it is tailored to educate and assist marketers at every level of their lifecycle, which, in turn, serves their customer lifecycles.\n\nWhat I like the best is the ability to scale with this product. Even if your organization is just ready for email marketing and landing pages, the software can be used for that, while introducing the layers of advanced analytics (like engagement scoring) at those stages. Once you're at a point where you can advance to the next level, it's easy to do so.\n\nI also like the recent UI and UX changes.
