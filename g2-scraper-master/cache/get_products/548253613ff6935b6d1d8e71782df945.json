It's also much easier/faster to set up integrations in other platforms but in Listrak, it has taken over 6 months to get two data fields into the system.\nThere are also funky things in the platform like Conversations vs. Journey Builder - Journey Builder looks like it would be easier to use than Conversations but I keep hearing that we shouldn't move over to it yet. My question is why is it live in the system if employees don't want to use it yet?\nI also think the navigation of the platform is confusing - there are way too many options and pages could easily be consolidated.\nIt's also strange that we can't build a custom dashboard to view reports - I get my reports weekly from our Account Manager and it's in a giant spreadsheet with a ton of tabs. It's helpful data but I'd like to view the reports/graphs that are important to me at any time - not once a week when it's emailed to me.\nWhen it comes to the lists, it bothers me that the data on lists are separate and it takes extra steps to get it all in sync. If I collect a customer's first name or their pet's names for example, I want that information tied to their email address available on all lists.\nIf I want to send a dedicated email to a subset of customers pulled from a different source, instead of creating a list for those contacts, it's easier to create a new profile field to track them, which is strange and it's why we have a bunch of old profile fields that need to be cleaned up."}, {"question": "What problems is Listrak solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "It's nice having a full-service team that implements many of the things we want."}], "review_rating": 4.0, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "Lauren B.", "reviewer_job_title": "NOT GIVEN", "reviewer_link": "https://www.g2.com/users/6b3b9d78-63af-4b5d-b38e-4f1e94088db7"}, "publish_date": "2023-04-04T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Small-Business(50 or fewer emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/listrak/reviews/listrak-review-7910099"}, {"review_id": 1844527, "review_title": "Seven Year Partnerhsip", "review_content": "What do you like best about Listrak?\nWe've been a partner with Listrak for nearly seven years.

I think a lot of that can depend on who your rep is though. However, if they aren't the right fit for you and your needs, Listrak can identify that and help find you someone who understands how you operate and how much or how little attention your account needs. They are great at letting you know new products are available but without pushing the product on you, or insisting you invest in something that might not be the right fit for your company. They are really about helping you grow based on your needs as a company and we have found that incredibly valuable."}, {"question": "What problems is Listrak solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "It has been a great email platform for us and we are really able to generate sales for the website quickly.

Our main reasons for switching to Listrak was to improve upon the prior ESP's shortcommings. At Listrak we found improved (and faster) reporting, an easier to use automated workflow tool and improved customer service. Besides these improvements, Listrak brought experience in the ecommerce category. The majority of our revenue is generated through ecommerce related email. Besides using Listrak for ecommerce emails we also send regular editorial newsletters and emails on behalf of our sponsors.\n\nListrak's back-end tools are the best we've used vs the three other vendors we have experienced. We currently use another ESP for one of our brands (required because of a third-party arrangment) and we wish we could switch from that system to Listrak which is far easier to use. We find the back-end systems easy to manage. The Composer tool was a huge improvment over their already useful editor. Our digital team are experienced coders, however the Composer greatly reduced the time to design email with it's simple drag/drop platform.

The support team is amazing so if there is something a user can't figure out on their own, someone on the Listrak side can generally help and resolve really quickly. Additionally account managers are incredible responsive and offer numerous ideas and tips for growing your email channel. Everyone I've worked with at Listrak is super helpful and if they don't have the answer to my question they find the person who has it.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Listrak?\nThe one downside I've found is that not all reports and functions meet the business specific requirements I'm looking for but this is something you'd find in any 3rd party tool. Listrak does offer a customer forum for suggestions on how to improve the platform and regularly uses the feedback to develop their roadmap but its not a guarantee that your idea will become a reality.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Listrak:\nListrak does take a lot of time to manage if you are using automated campaigns. I highly recommended have a dedicated person at your organization to manage the tool so that you can get a great ROI. I also recommend setting up regular meetings with your account manager so you can stay on top of the new ideas and developments that come out.\n\nWhat problems is Listrak solving and how is that benefiting you?\nI use Listrak for marketing sends, customer segmentation, product recommendations, Back in Stock Alerts and automated personalized campaigns.

The support team is amazing so if there is something a user can't figure out on their own, someone on the Listrak side can generally help and resolve really quickly. Additionally account managers are incredible responsive and offer numerous ideas and tips for growing your email channel.
