In the past we could see impressions and clicks and website visits from our campaigns. Now we are seeing the actual leads and being able to follow activity after the initial contact. The added visibility has been an absolute game changer in the value we can provide our clients.\n\nI really like the Life of the Lead feature where once you have a lead in the system you can track all their activity in great detail, seeing when they came back to the website, what pages they went to, if they opened emails, etc.\n\nWe've even had instances where clients claimed they were not getting leads from our campaigns and once SharpSpring was installed, not only could we now provide reports of leads we were generating, but we caught a hole in their customer service where leads we were providing were not getting responses from scheduling staff. So we not only provided reports of the leads we generated, but helped close a gap in a serious customer service issue that was happening.\n\nThe automations are really powerful and I like being able to have so much in one system.\n\nWe've also recently started using the CRM and the clients are really happy with the features of the CRM and having it work directly with marketing activities.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Constant Contact Advanced Automation & CRM Platform?\nIt takes more time to set things up, but its worth it for all the insights you gain. The design capabilities in the emails are a bit clunky and limited. Hopefully they will improve on that.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Constant Contact Advanced Automation & CRM Platform:\nThere are a lot of great features in SharpSpring to support clients success, so it's a great system to have. That said, if it only had its ability to track leads in detail I would still be sold on it for that feature alone. It does take some effort to get up to speed on everything. There are some funky things in learning process. For example, on triggers for sending an alert when a form is submitted, there was small function that made only send once that was easy to miss, so after I tested a form once, it no longer worked. Once support helped me figure this out it was all good. That said, their support is amazing and makes getting up to speed much easier.\n\nWhat problems is Constant Contact Advanced Automation & CRM Platform solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThe main problem as I mentioned above is that we previously had zero visibility into the leads we generated for clients. Relying on clients to accurately identify leads we brought to them was a recipe for failure and making us look bad.

Just when I think I've figured out the edge of the depth on the tool, I realize there's another level. The automation is top notch. The ability to track so many actions, behaviors and then to take action to help the customer go further along the funnel.

Considering I can tie all the potential avenues of a campaign into one spot and see how users interact with is a great win.  At a glance, it is essential to read the data and make the right decisions; SharpSpring brings all the data to one platform.  It makes work more enjoyable that we can create a single campaign with a list of contacts, email templates, unique forms, dynamic pages, trackable media, automation, and analytics in one spot.  Not to mention, once we create this base campaign and all its numerous pieces, I can then quickly use all the parts as a template to do another or a third, and so on.  Making it very efficient over time.  SharpSpring has a lot of features, but I am thrilled with our CRM, email marketing, ads, funnels, all in one location.  All this and the support team have been top-notch every step of the way.  I also like to learn myself, which they provide via courses, updated videos, and documents that my team and I can reference.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Constant Contact Advanced Automation & CRM Platform?\nInterface and design consistency are my two significant cons for this platform.

Considering I can tie all the potential avenues of a campaign into one spot and see how users interact with is a great win.  At a glance, it is essential to read the data and make the right decisions; SharpSpring brings all the data to one platform.  It makes work more enjoyable that we can create a single campaign with a list of contacts, email templates, unique forms, dynamic pages, trackable media, automation, and analytics in one spot.  Not to mention, once we create this base campaign and all its numerous pieces, I can then quickly use all the parts as a template to do another or a third, and so on.

The culture at the company is amazing which translates to a well thought out platform that is intuitive and rich with features and benefits for small to large organizations. SharpSpring is best leveraged in our experience for companies that have a steady flow of incoming leads from marketing efforts and they have a sales team that will leverage the data collected in the platform to assist in the process of nurturing and closing the deals they are working on.\n\nThe platform is scalable so that a company can start using the CRM and email messages as a phase 1 start and continually add more integration as time goes on.

I moved from Act-On which was expensive and a little overkill and was worried if Sharpspring support would suffer due to its lower price. It didn't. I am able to get through to the right person quickly and they even have that \"don't lose your place in line and we'll call you back\" feature. The support people are friendly, knowledgable, and patient. The platform itself is sophisticated but still intuitive.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Constant Contact Advanced Automation & CRM Platform?\nTherer's nothing I can think of that I don't like. I always would like platforms like these to be less expensive, but this is the most reasonably priced platforms I've looked at, and I looked at many. I wish they were open on weekends. They do have someone manning the Web chat feature though\n\nRecommendations to others considering Constant Contact Advanced Automation & CRM Platform:\nDo it. You can pay month-to-month, so it's not a big risk. It does everything that Act-On does, as far as I can see. Sharpspring may do things slightly differently from Act-On, but all platforms are a little different. As long as you know marketing automation, you'll have no problem at all.

Clients now are able to track where people came from, right through to the end of the sale, so that you understand how many leads a campaign generates and then how many sales you get from it to give you a clear ROI."}], "review_rating": 4.5, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "James P.", "reviewer_job_title": "Marketing Manager", "reviewer_link": "https://www.g2.com/users/e6a9f748-5428-4646-827e-d0a8d5c3be0b"}, "publish_date": "2019-11-08T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Small-Business(50 or fewer emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/constant-contact-advanced-automation-crm-platform/reviews/constant-contact-advanced-automation-crm-platform-review-3610127"}, {"review_id": 4282164, "review_title": "Powerful  marketing automation engine powers new business development", "review_content": "What do you like best about Constant Contact Advanced Automation & CRM Platform?\nMost helpful is the SmarMatil to track the behavior of prospects, provide lead scoring and segmentation\n\nWhat do you dislike about Constant Contact Advanced Automation & CRM Platform?\nThere would be a tendency to dive right in and bypass time spent onboarding.

As a B2B marketing agency, we were frustrated with our lack of ability to increase our value to clients beyond simply creating content. We lacked the ability to create landing pages or email campaigns, or the capability to give clients detailed insight into who was interacting with digital campaigns.  SharpSpring totally changes all of that. It gives us a huge new capability to offer clients inbound marketing and lead scoring as well other really valuable tools such as the ability to create attractive landing pages, forms and email campaigns. Of course, we can also create drip-feed email campaigns based on customer behaviours. The level of prospect insight is also key for clients who want to understand more about who is interacting with them digitally. We had been looking at other marketing automation platforms for a year (especially Hubspot) but the huge price tag was a barrier to entry. SharpSpring has completely transformed our offering to make it vastly more compelling to prospects and existing clients. This is especially the case as they include free licenses for us to use with clients as we see fit. I'll even venture, that SharpSpring is such good value that I had to see what the catch was....and there is none (they even give you a one month notice period). SharpSpring is great and once we have demonstrated the capabilities of the platform then to many people it's a no-brainer.

The free licenses that SharpSpring gives you are also vital in ensuring that you can onboard clients with little or no friction."}, {"question": "What problems is Constant Contact Advanced Automation & CRM Platform solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "SharpSpring is very likely to be the most important investment we have ever made in terms of tools and software. As a B2B marketing agency, we were frustrated with our lack of ability to increase our value to clients beyond simply creating content. We lacked the ability to create landing pages or email campaigns, or the capability to give clients detailed insight into who was interacting with digital campaigns.  SharpSpring totally changes all of that. It gives us a huge new capability to offer clients inbound marketing and lead scoring as well other really valuable tools such as the ability to create attractive landing pages, forms and email campaigns. Of course, we can also create drip-feed email campaigns based on customer behaviours. The level of prospect insight is also key for clients who want to understand more about who is interacting with them digitally. We had been looking at other marketing automation platforms for a year (especially Hubspot) but the huge price tag was a barrier to entry. SharpSpring has completely transformed our offering to make it vastly more compelling to prospects and existing clients. This is especially the case as they include free licenses for us to use with clients as we see fit. I'll even venture, that SharpSpring is such good value that I had to see what the catch was....and there is none (they even give you a one month notice period). SharpSpring is great and once we have demonstrated the capabilities of the platform then to many people it's a no-brainer. In time, I have no doubt that it will open up several other revenue streams."}], "review_rating": 5.0, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "James K.", "reviewer_job_title": "Director and co-founder", "reviewer_link": "https://www.g2.com/users/9d695a7a-ef6b-4433-877a-7e450655326c"}, "publish_date": "2017-08-03T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Small-Business(50 or fewer emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/constant-contact-advanced-automation-crm-platform/reviews/constant-contact-advanced-automation-crm-platform-review-361911"}, {"review_id": 356552, "review_title": "Powerful Program -- Another 'Must-have' in your Toolbox", "review_content": "What do you like best about Constant Contact Advanced Automation & CRM Platform?\nAfter reviewing several marketing platforms for ourselves as well as for our clients, we found SharpSpring to be the best of 'all' worlds.

I have used about a dozen different platforms from SMB to enterprise level (think Eloqua, Hubspot, Marketo) and this feature is only available in Sharpspring to my knowledge.

After one year of weaving SharpSpring into our business, we have seen huge growth for ourselves and for our clients as well. We love how SharpSpring positively positions our agency as the resource, it is very easy to get new licenses for clients, and their new billing structure makes it more affordable for smaller agencies like us to carry the costs. Also, we no longer need to have a separate landing page builder and email builder since SharpSpring does this all. We save a ton of time not having to do it this way anymore!\n\nWhat do you dislike about Constant Contact Advanced Automation & CRM Platform?\nParts of the platform lack features such as the email builder. I'm not crazy how their emails look on mobile. The app is almost useless for design and marketing purposes but it's great for entering contacts.

After one year of weaving SharpSpring into our business, we have seen huge growth for ourselves and for our clients as well.

When it comes to returning a robust marketing automation feature set at this price point, no other platform comes close.\n\nHaving worked as a Marketo partner for a few years and flirting on and off with Hubspot, I was blown away when I finally discovered SharpSpring. If you understand how to use marketing automation in a content marketing strategy, every critical feature and all of the flexibility of the other platforms is available in SharpSpring for a fraction of the cost.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Constant Contact Advanced Automation & CRM Platform?\nWhen you compare side by side, you will find that there are small features available in other platforms that you won't find in SharpSpring. But frankly, in my experience, the vast majority of these features apply to \"edge use case\" examples that will apply to a small minority of users at best, and, IMO, are foisted in the collateral and lauded by the sales reps more or less as a gimmick than an actual value add.\n\nAre you surprised that a company with a name like Marketo is pretty good at marketing?\n\nFor example, if you're doing an evaluation, ask yourself if you really think you're going to use that Revenue Cycle Analytics system. I'm betting your marketing team has better ways to spend their time.\n\nIn a nutshell, sure, if your company has \"more money than brains\" and a dozen marketers with nothing better to do, Marketo was custom built for you. Or if you enjoy reading amazing marketing blog content and want to make a trip to Boston each year to see comedians and pop stars share their marketing expertise, Hubspot may just be the right fit. (You were wondering where your exorbitant \"setup\" fees are going?)\n\nOn the other hand, if you're actually focused on building content marketing programs and need a solid technology backbone to operate and monitor your campaigns that doesn't eat half your budget for breakfast, stop wasting your time, SharpSpring is the droid you've been looking for.\n\nOf course, as a newer platform, SharpSpring does not yet have as many integrations available out of the box as the older platforms. This is something we'd all like to see and SharpSpring promises that they are always working on new integrations. There are, in fact, many existing third party integrations via Zapier, but you will still come across some marketing technologies that already connect to Marketo and Hubspot that aren't yet in the SharpSpring ecosystem. But that said, with the budget you save with an MA like SharpSpring, you can easily cover the cost of a custom integration if necessary.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Constant Contact Advanced Automation & CRM Platform:\nDo your homework. This comes down to feature set and price. When the sales team at the competitors tell you that this product \"can't possibly be that good at that price,\" you can smirk to yourself knowing that they know that they've lost the sale.\n\nWhat problems is Constant Contact Advanced Automation & CRM Platform solving and how is that benefiting you?\nHaving lots of anonymous visitors come to your website is nice, but not very useful to your sales team. Wouldn't it be nice to know the contact information of those visitors spending lots of time evaluating your products and services? Wouldn't it be nice if your primary sales problem was not finding new leads, but figuring out how to prioritize among the dozens of warm opportunities available in your pipeline?\n\nWithout great content, marketing automation is pointless. So the obvious math here is simple: the more money you spend on your marketing technology, the less spend you dedicate to your content. All things being equal, your technology needs to offer the feature set rich enough to operate your campaigns.  But beyond that, the determinative factors for your success are going to be based on the quality of the content you are offering, not on the useless bells and whistles in your technology stack.\n\nB2B content marketing strategy is about developing intelligent content offers that actually return real value to your audiences. To create this kind of content, you need to have a deep understanding of how your value propositions solve your prospects' pain points. You also need to understand what kind of content works best for your audiences and how to get your content in front of those audiences.  And finally, you need a way to turn those anonymous audiences into known leads and a way to warm those leads with strategic messaging so your sales team can close more deals.\n\nSharpSpring is the marketing technology we recommend to accomplish the last piece of that puzzle. But you will need a steady and persistent supply of high quality content to do effective marketing automation.  My job is to help my clients orchestrate and execute an intelligent strategy that combines both content and technology to deliver high quality marketing communications on a robust marketing technology backbone.", "review_question_answers": [{"question": "What do you like best about Constant Contact Advanced Automation & CRM Platform?", "answer": "Let's get straight to the point: the best thing about SharpSpring is cost performance. When it comes to returning a robust marketing automation feature set at this price point, no other platform comes close.\n\nHaving worked as a Marketo partner for a few years and flirting on and off with Hubspot, I was blown away when I finally discovered SharpSpring. If you understand how to use marketing automation in a content marketing strategy, every critical feature and all of the flexibility of the other platforms is available in SharpSpring for a fraction of the cost."}, {"question": "What do you dislike about Constant Contact Advanced Automation & CRM Platform?", "answer": "When you compare side by side, you will find that there are small features available in other platforms that you won't find in SharpSpring. But frankly, in my experience, the vast majority of these features apply to \"edge use case\" examples that will apply to a small minority of users at best, and, IMO, are foisted in the collateral and lauded by the sales reps more or less as a gimmick than an actual value add.\n\nAre you surprised that a company with a name like Marketo is pretty good at marketing?\n\nFor example, if you're doing an evaluation, ask yourself if you really think you're going to use that Revenue Cycle Analytics system. I'm betting your marketing team has better ways to spend their time.\n\nIn a nutshell, sure, if your company has \"more money than brains\" and a dozen marketers with nothing better to do, Marketo was custom built for you. Or if you enjoy reading amazing marketing blog content and want to make a trip to Boston each year to see comedians and pop stars share their marketing expertise, Hubspot may just be the right fit. (You were wondering where your exorbitant \"setup\" fees are going?)\n\nOn the other hand, if you're actually focused on building content marketing programs and need a solid technology backbone to operate and monitor your campaigns that doesn't eat half your budget for breakfast, stop wasting your time, SharpSpring is the droid you've been looking for.\n\nOf course, as a newer platform, SharpSpring does not yet have as many integrations available out of the box as the older platforms. This is something we'd all like to see and SharpSpring promises that they are always working on new integrations. There are, in fact, many existing third party integrations via Zapier, but you will still come across some marketing technologies that already connect to Marketo and Hubspot that aren't yet in the SharpSpring ecosystem. But that said, with the budget you save with an MA like SharpSpring, you can easily cover the cost of a custom integration if necessary."}, {"question": "Recommendations to others considering Constant Contact Advanced Automation & CRM Platform:", "answer": "Do your homework. This comes down to feature set and price. When the sales team at the competitors tell you that this product \"can't possibly be that good at that price,\" you can smirk to yourself knowing that they know that they've lost the sale."}, {"question": "What problems is Constant Contact Advanced Automation & CRM Platform solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "Having lots of anonymous visitors come to your website is nice, but not very useful to your sales team. Wouldn't it be nice to know the contact information of those visitors spending lots of time evaluating your products and services? Wouldn't it be nice if your primary sales problem was not finding new leads, but figuring out how to prioritize among the dozens of warm opportunities available in your pipeline?\n\nWithout great content, marketing automation is pointless. So the obvious math here is simple: the more money you spend on your marketing technology, the less spend you dedicate to your content. All things being equal, your technology needs to offer the feature set rich enough to operate your campaigns.  But beyond that, the determinative factors for your success are going to be based on the quality of the content you are offering, not on the useless bells and whistles in your technology stack.\n\nB2B content marketing strategy is about developing intelligent content offers that actually return real value to your audiences. To create this kind of content, you need to have a deep understanding of how your value propositions solve your prospects' pain points. You also need to understand what kind of content works best for your audiences and how to get your content in front of those audiences.  And finally, you need a way to turn those anonymous audiences into known leads and a way to warm those leads with strategic messaging so your sales team can close more deals.\n\nSharpSpring is the marketing technology we recommend to accomplish the last piece of that puzzle. But you will need a steady and persistent supply of high quality content to do effective marketing automation.  My job is to help my clients orchestrate and execute an intelligent strategy that combines both content and technology to deliver high quality marketing communications on a robust marketing technology backbone."}], "review_rating": 5.0, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "Travis S.", "reviewer_job_title": "President", "reviewer_link": "https://www.g2.com/users/8b2f14f7-60b4-4a26-a2ed-8e117fa27acc"}, "publish_date": "2016-10-13T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Small-Business(50 or fewer emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/constant-contact-advanced-automation-crm-platform/reviews/constant-contact-advanced-automation-crm-platform-review-161714"}, {"review_id": 246652, "review_title": "'Sharp-en' your game", "review_content": "What do you like best about Constant Contact Advanced Automation & CRM Platform?\nOpening the instance is incredibly easy.
