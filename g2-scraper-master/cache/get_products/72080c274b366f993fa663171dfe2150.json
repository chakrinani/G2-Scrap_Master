Some organizations want their CRM to have deep hooks into the marketing automation platform. Others - for a variety of reasons - do not. Makesbridge excels in this second scenario. Some of the stand-out features are Targets, which are dynamic lists and filters that allow marketers to fine-tune who they're pursuing and the ability to use multiple ISPs for email sending. The latter is a highly specific use case, but if you are running multiple and varied email campaigns with lists of varying quality, this feature, alone, could be a lifesaver. Though I've been in marketing automation, forever, my belief is that Makesbridge is likely more beginner-friendly than most other platforms, which would allow teams to see the value faster.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Makesbridge?\nNot so much as a dislike, but the product is intentionally designed not to interfere with SF. So whereas you can have automations change lead stages in the Pardots of the world, Makesbridge's touch is intentionally lighter. Depending on your org goals, that's a deal killer or not.\n\nWhat problems is Makesbridge solving and how is that benefiting you?\nMakesbridge does what most marketing automation software does - allows you to nurture prospects (particularly pre-SQL) through the funnel.

You won't have to hire special technical consultants or bring on expensive agencies just to get your marketing done.\n\nIf you are looking for advanced customizations and need to integrate with lots of advanced platforms, then make sure you can do so through Zapier. If not, you may want to consider one of the more expensive MAP options.\n\nWhat problems is Makesbridge solving and how is that benefiting you?\nI've used Makesbridge to manage all of my demand generation efforts. I use it for lead-generation, web tracking, automated lead segmentation, automated email nurturing, content delivery, lead scoring and qualification, sales hand-offs, etc.\n\nThe biggest benefit has been having everything up and live in a day.

It's Playbooks are like templates on steroids -- allowing you to deploy advanced campaigns and functionality in a few clicks and a few minutes (something I honestly didn't believe when I first read it).\n\nI was able to sign up for a free trial, select an initial campaign Playbook, and launch my first email campaign to my email list in about an hour. Setting up ALL of my advanced functionality took me the rest of the afternoon. (Other MAPs have taken me weeks or months to do the same.)\n\nI've been around the block a few times on MAPs (I've tried all of the main ones), and Makesbridge is ahead of the innovation curve when it comes to usability, deployability, and minimizing total cost of ownership.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Makesbridge?\nThe API integration with Makesbridge through Zapier is great (opening up lots of 3rd party functionality), and perfect for small and medium businesses that just need to connect Salesforce.com and a couple normal apps; however, when I'm connecting large and complex integration environments, I'd probably choose one of the big expensive MAP options with advanced API functionality and mature developer markets. Makesbridge is limited in its custom API integration options, just like HubSpot and Pardot are.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Makesbridge:\nIf you need a MAP that is affordable, can be set-up in a day, has killer (free!) support, and doesn't overcomplicate everything, then choose Makesbridge. You won't have to hire special technical consultants or bring on expensive agencies just to get your marketing done.\n\nIf you are looking for advanced customizations and need to integrate with lots of advanced platforms, then make sure you can do so through Zapier. If not, you may want to consider one of the more expensive MAP options.\n\nWhat problems is Makesbridge solving and how is that benefiting you?\nI've used Makesbridge to manage all of my demand generation efforts. I use it for lead-generation, web tracking, automated lead segmentation, automated email nurturing, content delivery, lead scoring and qualification, sales hand-offs, etc.\n\nThe biggest benefit has been having everything up and live in a day. Now I have a completely automated lead-generation funnel that hands pre-qualified sales-ready leads to my sales team, and all I have to do is throttle my ad spend.", "review_question_answers": [{"question": "What do you like best about Makesbridge?", "answer": "First, Makesbridge is super easy to set-up.
