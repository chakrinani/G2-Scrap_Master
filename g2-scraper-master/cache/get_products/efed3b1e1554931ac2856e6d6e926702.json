store additional information related to the aforementioned users, in a 1:1 relation. Tipically, you use them to store more dynamic information, like marketing preferences\n- Supplemental Tables, where you can store information both in a 1:N relation with the Contact List, or even without any relation. The classic example is a catalog table, where you store all the data about your products\nIn Responsys, you can use the classic Filters or even SQL views, to extract data from these tables, for example to create a specific audience.\nYou can set up and schedule jobs to import/export data from/to the external FTP server provided to you when you activate a Responsys account.\nCAMPAIGN CREATION\nThe campaign editor offers a great functionality called \"dynamic content regions\", that means you can create only one campaign, but personalize the content based on some list field (for example, 1 campaign with 10 languages, instead of having to create 10 different campaigns).\nAUTOMATIONS\nThe automation (which are called Programs) editor is a very easy-to-use drag and drop canvas, with a large variety of switches, timers and conditions to be matched in order to proceed along one path or another.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Oracle Responsys?\nThe integration process with the ecommerce is a bit tricky, and you will definitely need a skilled developer.\nMoreover, if you have both an Oracle Responsys account and an Oracle Commerce Cloud ecommerce, you will need a third billable Oracle prodcut to integrate them and take advantage of the possibility to have all the orders/products data synced.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Oracle Responsys:\nThe platform is an Oracle product, it is expensive and a bit tricky to learn in depth, but if you have a large amount of data available and want to make the best out of it, creating automations, personalized campaigns, and different user experiences, tailored for every contact you have, Responsys might be the right choice.\n\nWhat problems is Oracle Responsys solving and how is that benefiting you?\nOne problem we solved was the need to create N campaigns if you have to manage N possible values of a variable (the classic example is the user country/language), when using a different email marketing platform.

Salesforce, YesMail, and other platforms either don't give access to databases to the marketing team, or they don't have any databases. This causes marketing teams to be dependent upon a Business Intelligence team to build lists, etc. and most of your time is spent putting together campaigns instead of automating and analyzing. The most important key to this platform and making it successful is getting data into the system, and in what database you place it in. Make sure you pay attention to the functionality of all three databases and you're mapping data accordingly. This will make or break the product.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Oracle Responsys?\nThere are quirks to this platform, as would be expected of any enterprise solution. RPL is a language that can be used to program emails. However, Responsys doesn't tell you that RPL cannot be used in Forms to submit data until you reach out to Support and they give you the programming language you'll need. Why an issue like this exists is unexplainable and can be very frustrating when building. Also, the training for this product is very underwhelming. You can go to a 3rd party like Shaw + Scott, and it won't make any difference. This is the main reason the product is so misunderstood.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Oracle Responsys:\nThis platform is ONLY to be used by companies who are marketing-centric. Sadly, most places I consult allow the Business Intelligence team to control marketing. For those companies, Salesforce makes more sense. That is a batch-and-blast system that makes sense in the business intelligence driven world. However, if you're a company that is dedicated to marketing, who has a person/team dedicated to email who is self-motivated, this is the only platform to use. Your learning curve for content that resonates with your clients, etc. will be so much shorter and more aggressive in Responsys than any platform out there because you'll spend much more time analyzing and much less time building. You'll have to retrain your mind to work in a situation-centric mind frame instead of an individual driven marketing world (building lists). This is the most mis-understood ESP on the market and sadly most clients don't even come close to utilizing the system because they haven't been shown why it is so powerful.\n\nWhat problems is Oracle Responsys solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThe benefits are countless. I work at Accenture and have helped many clients in multiple verticals optimize this product. They have abandoned cart, confirmation email, SMS, MMS, display, and other automated functions that can be utilized. Sadly, most people don't understand the power of this tool. I've been using it since 2011 and it takes time, practice, and a change in perspective for most people and how they go about doing email.

This is the main reason the product is so misunderstood."}, {"question": "Recommendations to others considering Oracle Responsys:", "answer": "This platform is ONLY to be used by companies who are marketing-centric. Sadly, most places I consult allow the Business Intelligence team to control marketing. For those companies, Salesforce makes more sense. That is a batch-and-blast system that makes sense in the business intelligence driven world. However, if you're a company that is dedicated to marketing, who has a person/team dedicated to email who is self-motivated, this is the only platform to use. Your learning curve for content that resonates with your clients, etc. will be so much shorter and more aggressive in Responsys than any platform out there because you'll spend much more time analyzing and much less time building. You'll have to retrain your mind to work in a situation-centric mind frame instead of an individual driven marketing world (building lists). This is the most mis-understood ESP on the market and sadly most clients don't even come close to utilizing the system because they haven't been shown why it is so powerful."}, {"question": "What problems is Oracle Responsys solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "The benefits are countless. I work at Accenture and have helped many clients in multiple verticals optimize this product. They have abandoned cart, confirmation email, SMS, MMS, display, and other automated functions that can be utilized. Sadly, most people don't understand the power of this tool. I've been using it since 2011 and it takes time, practice, and a change in perspective for most people and how they go about doing email. If you embrace the power of the tool and dedicate a marketing person to this platform, the possibilities are endless."}], "review_rating": 5.0, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "Michael S.", "reviewer_job_title": "Responsys Strategist", "reviewer_link": "https://www.g2.com/users/470058a5-8e11-4405-8976-e7ba5e08fcb4"}, "publish_date": "2018-04-16T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Enterprise(> 1000 emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/oracle-responsys/reviews/oracle-responsys-review-672218"}, {"review_id": 1974013, "review_title": "Love Responsys, So/so on Oracle", "review_content": "What do you like best about Oracle Responsys?\nResponsys Platform, Responsys reps and how it interacts with other software and technology\n\nWhat do you dislike about Oracle Responsys?\nOracle and trying to sell me EVERYTHING!

As with other reviewers, Responsys is an extremely robust tool. From security to customisation, if you are well resourced (both in monetary and human resource).\n\nWhat do you dislike about Oracle Responsys?\nYou have to ask yourself, do I need an enterprise solution? Or, do I just need to do the basics? Yes the below is subjective as I represent a small business. Ready through the following 10 tips to evaluate whether Responsys is worth putting into your consideration set.\n\n1. Responsys is priced as an enterprise solution. I've never seen such a high CPM cost for sending <20M emails p.a. in my career? Why? They cost their services as a 'blended CPM'. Vs just a CPM for email sends.\n\n2. You will need developers to use the product. Don't bother considering Responsys unless you have a robust front/back-end development team. If you don't, you'll have Responsys users getting very frustrated by a product far too advanced for the average marketer.\n\n3. It is a min. requirement you know SQL to be an user of this product. Have a junior marketer who needs to use Responsys? Get them trained on SQL as it'll really help.\n\n4. Training is too broad and expensive. In-person or online, their training skims over how to use their features vs. going deeper into common challenges marketers face. Real missed opportunities here by their training teams.\n\n5. All post-integrations will cost money. Best you allocate at least another 10-15% on-top of the annual fee as you need to have budget reserved to further optimise Responsys to your needs.\n\n6. Unless you pay, you'll get basic, reactive account management included. Smaller clients will get an account manager who manages at least 6 clients = can be a challenge to get a hold of them at short notice.\n\n7. Need quick technical support? You'll have to' raise a ticket for that. If you need a quick answer for a question, Oracle support typically wont be able to help on the spot. This can quickly amplify your frustration if you just need somebody to guide you through usability challenge within the platform.\n\n8. The interface is not for dummies. It is clunky to use at times. It take quite a long time to send a campaign if you do not use the campaign on a daily basis. I like to think of ESP programs to be easy as learning Google Analytics. A day or two and you can generally find your way. Not here. You really need to be trained up to use the interface.\n\n9. Not a turn-key ESP. Everything has to be customised from scratch with Responsys which is frustrating. It is similar to Airbus creating the A380 aeroplane. They manufacture the plan but it is up to the airline to customise it.\n\n10. Basic campaign insight for an enterprise solution. The architecture is the USP here, not the insight tools. If you need an ESP that provides a mini-BI tool, you will not get this from Responsys Insights (the name for their reporting tool). It only provides basic email behaviour reporting.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Oracle Responsys:\nIf you can support an enterprise ESP, consider Responsys. I.e. you need 3-5 staff to get Responsys up and running otherwise you'll haemorrhage cash like a slot machine. A combination of developers, a mid-level marketer and manager to lay down the strategic objectives to Responsys will yield the best ROI.\n\nWhen you look at the 'Marketing Automation features' section of this review, note all is possible 'if you pay to integrate it'. Typically, unless you can integrate INTO Responsys, you cannot access/use it.\n\nWhat problems is Oracle Responsys solving and how is that benefiting you?\nTrying to create a meaningful dialogue with the customer through the email medium. With the romantic view of 'doing the basics well', the Responsys platform has forced us to really understand the customer journey and how email plays a part in conversion. Their platform is very robust with many fail safes should the user miss particular detail. For example, when creating an automated email program, the canvas tool is very robust highlighting potential errors and warnings e.g. customers who could receive more than 5 emails per week.", "review_question_answers": [{"question": "What do you like best about Oracle Responsys?", "answer": "Responsys is the Ferrari of ESPs.
