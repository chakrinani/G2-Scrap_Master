Instead of having different tools for various parts of our marketing strategy, Lead Liaison is able to perform all of those under one integrated platform.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Lead Liaison?\nThe fact that there are so many features in the tool can make it feel overwhelming at times.  Also, there are places where the graphical interface interaction could be improved.\n\nThese concerns are why I appreciate the technical support so much.  Much of the issues I have raised have been integrated in later releases of the software.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Lead Liaison:\nYou will need someone with technical abilities (though not HTML coding skills) to successfully implement the tool.  In our organization, we had a creative person developing the content and planning the strategy, and we had a analytical person who worked on implementing the processes in Lead Liaison.\n\nKeep in mind that this is not just an email campaign tool, even though it is quite good at this basic task.\n\nWhat problems is Lead Liaison solving and how is that benefiting you?\nOur small business could not afford hiring multiple sales people to sell our consulting services nationwide.  So we used Lead Liaison to magnify the people resources we did have.
