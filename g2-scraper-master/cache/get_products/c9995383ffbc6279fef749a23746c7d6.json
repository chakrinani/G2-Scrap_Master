I'm also very encouraged how much functionality this has as such a young product. Seriously, I'm sooo excited to see how this product develops, and happy I'm part of it.\n\nVISUAL PROGRAMMING FOR AUTOMATION SEQUENCES - As a creative designer, I always appreciate when a company allows me to visually design programmed elements. I can layout a visual sequence, screancap the flow, and send it off to my advisors for their input. Love it!!\n\nULTRA RESPONSIVE SUPPORT - I just HAVE to bring this one up again! So often, I've found tools that have such potential and look great... but then you hear crickets when you need some feedback. Look, we're all moving fast and working hard to build our dreams, and we can't risk one of our vendors dampening our momentum by waiting days for answers. Vbout clearly recognizes this, and they make me feel like they are in our corner to help us reach our goals."}], "review_rating": 5.0, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "Chaplain Tim ", "reviewer_job_title": "Founder | Lead Chaplain", "reviewer_link": "https://www.g2.com/users/c79c9f1b-67c4-4aa5-8e2b-420d1f30c856"}, "publish_date": "2021-09-27T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Small-Business(50 or fewer emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/vbout/reviews/vbout-review-5020713"}, {"review_id": 5474311, "review_title": "Amazing company to work with", "review_content": "What do you like best about VBOUT?\nTheir customer support is outstanding.

I wanted an email marketing solution, but I also wanted SMS via Twilio. Vbout happens to have both of those. I prefer email limits vs. subscriber limits, and Vbout just so happens to be that as well. I wanted agency options, and they have that, too!\n\nThe extras I didn't expect but are nice to have: email template builder, the landing page builder, with integrated forms, and for some reason even a social media scheduler, AND social inbox?!\n\nTo top that off, there is great, responsive support.\n\nBecause Vbout does so much, some may assume it is a \"jack of all trades, master of none\" but I don't think that is true. It does several things at least as well as competitors, with some extras that are helpful but average. Even if we chop those extras off, the core offering would still be very competitive. It would be unreasonable to expect this to have, say, page-building capabilities that are every bit as good as dedicated page builders ON TOP of the solid core email marketing offerings.\n\nAnd just to add even more to the offer, there is a comprehensive onboarding process filled with video guides to get you started. Unbelievable.\n\nWhat do you dislike about VBOUT?\nI want a better website importer. I don't expect the Vbout page builder to be excellent. It is functional, but I have other dedicated builders I can use to make websites. The current importer does an average job of this and has weird quirks (like you have to name the HTML file the same as the zip file, or you run into an error). I would like to see page import better supported, so I can build websites with dedicated builders, import to Vbout, and then integrate that site with Vbout's forms and automation.\n\nA RSS feed feature would also be appreciated in the social media scheduler. Although if I am to be honest, a better way to integrate with outside tools would actually be the best solution to me. I have other dedicated tools already for various tasks, and I do not need to do everything within Vbout.\n\nA more intuitive way to work with the API would also be helpful. It is currently not that user friendly.\n\nRecommendations to others considering VBOUT:\nVbout has many tools, but some you might not really need because you already have dedicated tools. Page builder, I already have many. Email template builder I'd prefer Stripo. The social media scheduler does not do RSS, and I already have other schedulers that do the job. A better way to import results from outside tools is preferred. Having said that, DO NOT be distracted by these average extras; pay attention to the very solid core offering!\n\nThe core offering of email marketing automation is great. Just be aware of the strict terms of service. The TOS is understandable to protect the company and to protect all users of the platform, but it IS there so, please be aware of it.\n\nWhat problems is VBOUT solving and how is that benefiting you?\nVbout is my primary email marketing platform outside of the WordPress ecosystem (I have other CRMs for that). I wanted Twilio SMS as part of my automation, and Vbout has that. I am also using the social media scheduler for some tasks, but there are no RSS feed features that I am aware of, so this tool sees some but limited usage.", "review_question_answers": [{"question": "What do you like best about VBOUT?", "answer": "Vbout has almost everything I was looking for in a digital marketing SaaS, AND some extras I didn't expect but are excellent additions.

Unbelievable."}, {"question": "What do you dislike about VBOUT?", "answer": "I want a better website importer. I don't expect the Vbout page builder to be excellent. It is functional, but I have other dedicated builders I can use to make websites. The current importer does an average job of this and has weird quirks (like you have to name the HTML file the same as the zip file, or you run into an error). I would like to see page import better supported, so I can build websites with dedicated builders, import to Vbout, and then integrate that site with Vbout's forms and automation.\n\nA RSS feed feature would also be appreciated in the social media scheduler. Although if I am to be honest, a better way to integrate with outside tools would actually be the best solution to me. I have other dedicated tools already for various tasks, and I do not need to do everything within Vbout.\n\nA more intuitive way to work with the API would also be helpful. It is currently not that user friendly."}, {"question": "Recommendations to others considering VBOUT:", "answer": "Vbout has many tools, but some you might not really need because you already have dedicated tools. Page builder, I already have many. Email template builder I'd prefer Stripo. The social media scheduler does not do RSS, and I already have other schedulers that do the job. A better way to import results from outside tools is preferred. Having said that, DO NOT be distracted by these average extras; pay attention to the very solid core offering!\n\nThe core offering of email marketing automation is great. Just be aware of the strict terms of service. The TOS is understandable to protect the company and to protect all users of the platform, but it IS there so, please be aware of it."}, {"question": "What problems is VBOUT solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "Vbout is my primary email marketing platform outside of the WordPress ecosystem (I have other CRMs for that).

Vbout support looked into the issue and resolved it increasing deliverability by over 27%, and have now built nifty features to ensure that emails are being sent correctly.
