There are strong ones out there that are either purpose built for certain industries or have an insane amount of customization, or really deep granularity in how it operates. Thryv is definitely designed as a more general purpose software, but that is perfectly fine in this day and age where sometimes too much can be just that, too much.  A big hit compared to those programs is the affordability of Thryv, which makes it much more ideal for smaller businesses who don't have the millions of dollars of revenue to justify those big purchases, some of which are per each user. For us, the affordable price that covers all the users we need is great. Its easy to use, I like the feature of the teams chat built into Thryv directly which makes it easy for the whole team to catch up on things that are going on if someone is not in the office. Integration of the social media directly into the system is rather nice. Also at the end of the day, its super easy to use every day.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Thryv?\nThe app needs some optimization.

Its benefitting us by making everything centralized and accessible from anywhere.", "review_question_answers": [{"question": "What do you like best about Thryv?", "answer": "There are a lot of CRM software available nowadays. There are strong ones out there that are either purpose built for certain industries or have an insane amount of customization, or really deep granularity in how it operates. Thryv is definitely designed as a more general purpose software, but that is perfectly fine in this day and age where sometimes too much can be just that, too much.  A big hit compared to those programs is the affordability of Thryv, which makes it much more ideal for smaller businesses who don't have the millions of dollars of revenue to justify those big purchases, some of which are per each user. For us, the affordable price that covers all the users we need is great. Its easy to use, I like the feature of the teams chat built into Thryv directly which makes it easy for the whole team to catch up on things that are going on if someone is not in the office.

My favorite feature was that they claimed to be able to bill customers on auto-pilot each month. It was the top reason I went with them. We're a small company and couldn't afford to have to chase our payments each month. After signing up, and entering into the infamous 6 month contract, I discovered that it doesn't do that at all. The feature flat out doesn't work. I set up our first client to be billed twice a month, only to discover that the software didn't even attempt to charge him. So, I called in, and that is when I discovered that the normal customer service department DOESN'T handle anything that involves payments, and the payment department (they call it Thryv Pay) goes home at 3 PM SHARP.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Thryv?\nWhen I first signed up for Thryv, I was pitched the dream of how wonderful it was. I was sent emails, where they would offer me things like free t-shirts, free Amazon gift cards and even free services if I went and left a review for them. These offers came in fast after signing up, within the first week, and they kept coming. Go to G2 and leave a review and you'll get a free Amazon gift card, then a week later, go to another site and leave another review (you can even copy and paste your G2 review) and we'll send you a t-shirt. Then the big one came. We will give you a full video production package, send out a crew to you, we'll film you and your clients and edit the videos and give you 10 different versions of them IF you do a video review for us. All these came in the first 30 days of being with Thryv. This was before I even had an attempt to fully try out the software.\n\nThe person who works in billing and handles your account if you want to cancel is a piece of work. I went from dissatisfied to disgusted. Disgusted that I trusted this company with my time, my money and my energy. Now, I wish I never met them.\n\nIt's interesting, how companies that require a contract will tell you whatever they need to get your business, but as soon as you try to hold them to that it's \"Well you have a 6-month contract, so you'll have to keep it another 3 months. It's written in the contract you signed.\" Okay, you're right. I signed a contract because I TRUSTED you when I clearly should not have. Now I have a 6-month contract for a CRM software that doesn't provide the service they \"contracted\" for.\n\nWhat problems is Thryv solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThe reason I purchased Thryv and signed a contract with them is for the ability to use scheduled payments (auto billing), and it doesn't work. I can stick around and see if it gets better, but that would mean, I'd have to go in and schedule next month's payments for all my clients and PRAY that it works because if it doesn't 75% of my month's revenue will be lost until I can manually chase it down.  Or I could test it out again, and put only one client in the system and PRAY that one works, but if it doesn't work, I will have to wait another month to test another one. Such a waste of time.\n\nThryv is creating more problems than it is solving. I was prepared to chalk it up as a learning experience, and just walk away, but when I tried to cancel, I was told. \"Well, we've given you credits in the last 3 months, so you've only paid for one month, and therefore you'll have to keep it until after your Sept payment (3 months away)\".  Oh, I see, so even though you've wasted my time, energy and resources for 3 months, and the software doesn't do what you told me it would do, I'm required to keep paying for it, even though you know it is providing no benefit to me and my small business?
