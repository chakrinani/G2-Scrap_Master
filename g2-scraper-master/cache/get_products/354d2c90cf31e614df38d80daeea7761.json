They give you every advantage under the sun to be successful in your business through their features and individualized customer support.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Kartra?\nWell since my first review. Alot happened. Shortly after I did this review, something very strange happened.\nI woke up, did my thing and sat down in front of my laptop to login to my Kartra account.\nEverything seemed normal, entered my username & password then clicked login.\nNext thing i know, a popup appears telling me I have been blocked and to contact chat support.\nNow aside from trying to figure out why i was blocked, I now needed to find a way to contact chat support, from the outside of my Kartra account.\nNot an easy thing to do. My only option was to wait until I was in a different IP and try and login.\nWhen all of those methods failed , days had turned into weeks, and weeks into months.\nI had an associate who I iknew also had a Kartra account forward a message for me to Kartra support, explaining the situation.\nAnother few weeks later, I was finally contacted by someone at Kartra, who never really told me anything. Just that I was no longer welcome at Kartra.\nThis sudden lockout, cost me an entire years worth of commissions. Because as soon as I was locked out, everything in my account failed to renew, failed to re-activate and so on. None of my optin pages worked, my funnels were no more and basically my entire online business dissolved.\nTo this very day, I have never been told WHY this happened, or anything. You would think that for something to end like this, the way it ended, that you would want to let this customer/client know exactly what happened. So they may learn and gain a better understanding of what happened.\nKartra in this matter chose to ignore me, lock me out of everything, blacklist me. Totally breaking my online into tiny scattered pieces that I couldnt rebuild quite the same and it never did gain traction again.\nI wish I had more to tell you but even I dont know and will never know why , out of the blue, i was locked out, never to return to Kartra.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Kartra:\nMy advice. If you are serious about your business, and are looking for a platform that will give you the most solid foundation to grow and provide outstanding value to your clients and customers, then you owe it yourself & your business to make Kartra your home.\n\nWhile the product itself is excellent, if you are unsure about something or dont have much experience with a funnel builder service like this, i would shy away cause as soon as something goes wrong, youll get shut out, shut down and out of business before you even know what happened.\n\nWhat problems is Kartra solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThe major problem that I had was being able to see exactly what I had as far as campaign 'pieces'.  You'll wonder how your business ran without Kartra because when you dont have to log into separate websites for software, autoresponder's, Domain & Hosting vendors and page builders, are able to address ALL those aspects and more under 1 roof, you'll never want to use any other platform for your business.", "review_question_answers": [{"question": "What do you like best about Kartra?", "answer": "Aside from the all-inclusive, email marketing, list building, web hosting, page building & so much more business management platform, the best feature I like best is knowing if you need help or support for anything, that Kartra is there for you.

So they may learn and gain a better understanding of what happened.\nKartra in this matter chose to ignore me, lock me out of everything, blacklist me.

If you are serious about your business, and are looking for a platform that will give you the most solid foundation to grow and provide outstanding value to your clients and customers, then you owe it yourself & your business to make Kartra your home.\n\nWhile the product itself is excellent, if you are unsure about something or dont have much experience with a funnel builder service like this, i would shy away cause as soon as something goes wrong, youll get shut out, shut down and out of business before you even know what happened."}, {"question": "What problems is Kartra solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "The major problem that I had was being able to see exactly what I had as far as campaign 'pieces'.  You'll wonder how your business ran without Kartra because when you dont have to log into separate websites for software, autoresponder's, Domain & Hosting vendors and page builders, are able to address ALL those aspects and more under 1 roof, you'll never want to use any other platform for your business."}], "review_rating": 2.5, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "Robin L.", "reviewer_job_title": "Owner", "reviewer_link": "https://www.g2.com/users/50a65fcb-6500-4dc3-8857-3a6dc4c3f422"}, "publish_date": "2022-04-09T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Small-Business(50 or fewer emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/kartra/reviews/kartra-review-4183886"}, {"review_id": 5477935, "review_title": "Kartra Review", "review_content": "What do you like best about Kartra?\nI love that cartra allows for such a debt\n\nWhat do you dislike about Kartra?\nI love that kartra allows for such a depth and breath of cloud storage and I can easily store anything related to business practices at the touch of a button/upload.

Many features, little mastery.", "review_content": "What do you like best about Kartra?\nKartra is an all-in-one solution that will potentially take the place of many separate providers.\n\nThe email marketing system is simple to use and an email blast can be sent out rapidly and efficiently compared to my experience with Mailchimp.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Kartra?\nThe calendar system, in particular, is repetitive and cannot be cloned to create additional classes. Rescheduling classes is difficult, adding text in certain areas for instruction while booking is not intuitive and if you add these instructions where it allows space, those instructions are also used on a second page, after the reservation is made, where it looks like an error because it's completely inappropriate placement after booking. There are so many little issues like this throughout the system.\n\nWith customising the content, some areas us RGB color scheme, others use HEX and yet others cannot be customised at all and you need to select one of the colors in the array given.\n\nThe membership areas are not nearly as customisable as the pages, which is a disappointment because the  flashy sales pages may bring in the customers, but the membership area is what the audience pays for.\n\nImporting an email list that was collected from Mailchimp or other source can be difficult to impossible and I have had several lists not approved.\n\nI understand that Kartra is a very complex system, but it is far from ideal and the requested upgrades are painfully slow. I've been using Kartra for 10 months now and I have two memberships built, numerous pages, and over 10 classes on two calendars.

Rescheduling classes is difficult, adding text in certain areas for instruction while booking is not intuitive and if you add these instructions where it allows space, those instructions are also used on a second page, after the reservation is made, where it looks like an error because it's completely inappropriate placement after booking. There are so many little issues like this throughout the system.\n\nWith customising the content, some areas us RGB color scheme, others use HEX and yet others cannot be customised at all and you need to select one of the colors in the array given.\n\nThe membership areas are not nearly as customisable as the pages, which is a disappointment because the  flashy sales pages may bring in the customers, but the membership area is what the audience pays for.\n\nImporting an email list that was collected from Mailchimp or other source can be difficult to impossible and I have had several lists not approved.\n\nI understand that Kartra is a very complex system, but it is far from ideal and the requested upgrades are painfully slow.

It's superb and very informative; however, it's still in its infancy and you have to wait until they create the next lesson before you can do in-depth with whatever topic they decide, and that was often frustrating. With that said, however, they also do a lot of webinars that are in-depth and full of insight, but sitting through a webinar to find one answer is a bit defeating when you're in a hurry or just not really sure what exactly you're even looking for.

I don't like being held to rigid flows, templates and outlines. There's also not a way to remove their branding from emails, just so you know, in case that's a big turn-off for you. Kartra requires a lot of back and forth and in the beginning that can be extra confusing and frustrating.
