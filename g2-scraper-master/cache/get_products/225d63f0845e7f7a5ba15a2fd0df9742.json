It has effectively integrated with our CRM System, Salesforce. You can pull reports, gather customer buying journey data, develop content for specific departments within the company, and assign users access to that content.\n\nLead scoring and nurturing capabilities in Eloqua are a premium feature of this tool, in my opinion. The lead scoring options are vast, so you can ensure that your marketing qualified leads are indeed qualified.\n\nThe largest benefit for my team is the ability to designate levels of accessibility for different groups. We have a marketing operations department that builds the templates, manages distribution lists, and develops automated programs. Marketing specialists do not have access to those features but can easily pull reports on their campaigns without having to go into the back-end of the system. Our salespeople can access Eloqua Engage right from our CRM, so they can use readily-available and approved templates at their convenience without having to request anything from marketing.\n\nThe landing page customizability was an important feature for our team. We want our landing pages to look professional, and other systems we have used don't offer the level of quality we're looking for. Eloqua has templates you can choose from, but the level of customization is unparalleled. Our operations team can quickly design a landing page that is professional-grade.\nIf we have run into any issues, we're able to contact support and quickly come up with a solution. The Eloqua support team is knowledgeable, responsive, and helpful.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Oracle Eloqua?\nTo build templates, you should have a steady working knowledge of HTML coding. I do not, so I have to rely on others to create the templates I need. For my team, this is an extreme bottleneck. I have to wait on the one person who is capable of building templates in an HTML format. If you are not a fluent coder, this may not be the best tool for you. However, if you do have extensive HTML knowledge, you may enjoy this tool.\n\nEven my experienced coder has issues writing code within the tool- often they have to do so in a separate application and paste it into Eloqua's system.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Oracle Eloqua:\nIf you are a medium or large organization with a need for a heavy-duty marketing tool, Eloqua is a great system to use. You will need someone with coding experience to optimize the use of this tool. Eloqua is expensive, so I recommend that you assure the cost doesn't outweigh the benefits.\n\nWhat problems is Oracle Eloqua solving and how is that benefiting you?\nOur previous system did not natively integrate with our CRM, causing issues with syncing and data integrity. Eloqua seamlessly connects to Salesforce, so we are able to pull reports and gather metrics with a few clicks.

Additionally, Eloqua is sold as a \"do it all\" platform, but it actually requires connectors and custom development to get to that point. Some of the connectors are expensive, as well.\n\nAdditionally, Eloqua's \"responsive\" email tempaltes do not work across all devices. It's been our experience that custom coded HTML emails fully tested outside of Eloqua (using Litmus or Email on Acid) work best.\n\nThere is also a steep learning curve. I've been using Eloqua for over 3 years now and only in the last year did I start feeling confident with it.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Oracle Eloqua:\nBe aware that you will need additional connectors and development resources if you want to use Eloqua as a true conductor for digital marketing.

The \"campaign canvas\" as they call it allows the user to drag and drop segments, assets, decision steps, and action steps with ease.  Creating emails, landing pages, and forms within an easy to navigate editor is a huge plus.  Eloqua also integrates seamlessly with Compendium, Oracle's Content Management platform.  Content can be vetted and approved from Compendium and promoted into Eloqua and used within emails, landing pages, and dynamic content modules.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Oracle Eloqua?\nThe event and custom data modules still appear to be on the old Eloqua 9 UI.  That needs to be updated ASAP.  The program builder, while a great tool, is tough to navigate and can be rough when building a new program for the first few times.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Oracle Eloqua:\nGreat tool for the money.  If used correctly you can do wonderful things for your direct marketing.

The choices after that seem to take into account sacrificing certain aspects of marketing automation in exchange for a lower cost. If you want a scalable tool, this is the one for you. They have years on their closest competitor which means a lot more integration experience and native connections than possible with other tools. For an SMB, you have a lot of options in the space and using Eloqua might be like driving a Ferrari to pick up groceries; however, they have a pricing model and edition trim for SMB, as well. You don't have to drive the Ferarri, there is a grocery-getter, as well.\n\nI have used the tool for 7 years mostly in conjunction with Salesforce.com and the integration between those two systems is cake-walk. The amount of time these two have been partners really shows in it's native connectivity strength.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Oracle Eloqua?\nEloqua is Software-as-a-Service and is constantly being patched and upgraded, so naturally there are some quirks and bugs. I understand this. If I wanted static software that was bulletproof, I would buy a CD. Hang tight and these issues will get resolved. 7 years of experience with Eloqua is telling you this.\n\nOne area that has fallen behind is the Eloqua Support, likely due to the acquisition and hoping this is just a growing pain, which is the impression that I am getting. There are a few more hoops to jump through and the new Oracle Support interface wasn't the easiest to transition into, but once you have tickets open--they get responded to just like before.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Oracle Eloqua:\nEverything is contingent on where you want to go with your automation strategy. Eloqua is the industry standard for a reason--they've been in the marketing automation space significantly longer than their closest competitor and do provide the best suite of tools to support it.\n\nThe team edition or \"standard edition\" can be enough for a company that is an enterprise company, but not quite there yet with their automation strategy. Meaning, you don't necessarily have to buy the Enterprise edition just because you are an enterprise-level company. There is an affordable trim for smaller companies, as well, but there are a lot of competitor options for these smaller businesses, as well.\n\nWhat problems is Oracle Eloqua solving and how is that benefiting you?\nRenewals and vendor shopping when contracts near expiration is always a hurdle. Price will always be a factor. Switching from one platform for another is almost never a lateral move, so make sure you choose the right one for your company from the start. If you intend to switch purely for monetary reasons, you may want to reconsider due to the large step backwards to do so. This will cost more than the savings would catch up to in years. If you have legitimate concerns about the platforms performance, I would do a lot of research to make sure the competitor doesn't have the same or worse. Also, another thing to consider is with a newer platform competitor means fewer experts to turn to, either as consultants or new hire employees.

If you weren't a power user, you couldn't use E9. The time delay for lead insertion into Salesforce was a major problem for us. It could take up too 6 hours. Our upgrade from E9 to E10 was a complete disaster. Because E10 doesn't use the prospects table and one of my CRM integration programs referenced the prospects table for super region assignment (this was identified as known and acceptable by the upgrade team), none of my net-new leads would submit to salesforce. It took us nearly 8 weeks and about $5K in consulting services hours (I couldn't get the attention of anyone at Eloqua to solve the problem, so I had to hire a consulting firm) to isolate the issue. For 8 weeks I had to manually update leads to Salesforce.
