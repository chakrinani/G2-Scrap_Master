With Insider's personalized recommendations, we were able to improve product discovery and reduce the time users would need to spend looking for those products. This has helped us reduce bounce rate as customers end up staying on the platform browsing more products for a longer duration of time.\n\nWe observed that the conversion rate using Insider is 80% higher than our CR otherwise, which is 3 times more. This is a telling metric for how well Insider is working for us.\n\nWe also used Web Push to target users who have visited our platform and made some engagement and also the users who haven't visited our website for a long time. We were able to send out instant push messages once users left the website after viewing products and brought them back to our website to complete the purchase.

Insider's comprehensive suite of tools has helped us communicate with customers with a multi-channel marketing strategy.\nWe reached out to customers on their preferred channel rather than them reaching out to us. Insider's Web Push, Mobile App, and Email tools enabled us to maintain a consistent communication with our users. Web Suite ensured we keep these communications personalized and relevant to our customers, and Recommendation ensured we only flash information the customer is genuinely interested in.\nArchitect played an instrumental role in automating our marketing processes and efficiently mapping customer touchpoints which ensured that messages across multiple channels (web notification, email, app notification) were consistent, relevant, and personalized and constantly nudged the buyer to take action just in time.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Insider?\nInsider offers a plethora of templates across each of its tools be it emails, app notifications, or web push notifications which kind of boggled us in the beginning. However, Insider's growth experts were quick to step in and help us pick and choose the templates most suited to our needs. The results have been indeed mind-blowing.\n\nWhat problems is Insider solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThe biggest challenge we faced was perhaps sending a consistent message across all communication channels, and Insider helped us achieve that.

We haven't found any other platform which allows us to seamlessly integrate onsite and offsite experiences and siloed data to provide us with a single and unified view of each user to understand their behavior across different devices, channels and touchpoints. Insider's Customer Data Platform (CDP) is also the best in the business as it is able to capture siloed user data from these different channels and bring them to one central location for us to draw insights and act on it to create engaging personalized cross-channel experiences.\n\nWhen using Insider, another important feature that played a key role for us was dynamic segmentation between our users from different countries. This may seem like a pretty simple concept, but it was something that no other vendor previously offered us.\n\nWe are very impressed by the effectiveness of the various tools on Insider.

We haven't found any other platform which allows us to seamlessly integrate onsite and offsite experiences and siloed data to provide us with a single and unified view of each user to understand their behavior across different devices, channels and touchpoints. Insider's Customer Data Platform (CDP) is also the best in the business as it is able to capture siloed user data from these different channels and bring them to one central location for us to draw insights and act on it to create engaging personalized cross-channel experiences.\n\nWhen using Insider, another important feature that played a key role for us was dynamic segmentation between our users from different countries. This may seem like a pretty simple concept, but it was something that no other vendor previously offered us.\n\nWe are very impressed by the effectiveness of the various tools on Insider.

Within the first month, we saw that our conversion rate on the website increased by 2.5% and on the app, it grew by 3.2%."}, {"question": "What do you dislike about Insider?", "answer": "The price is somewhat higher though after seeing the results, I can definitely say that it's worth the investment."}, {"question": "What problems is Insider solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "Since there are a number of products listed on our website and app, Insider has helped me place products under relevant categories.

We work with different vendors but Insider has the best team and the best expertise.

So, we have no complaints about the rest of the issues.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Insider:\nMy main advice would be to discuss in detail everything you want to receive from Insider beforehand, because due to the large number of products it is very easy to get confused and to start not from the relevant one. Discuss everything with Insider digital consultants, they will definitely help you.\n\nWhat problems is Insider solving and how is that benefiting you?\nWe started working with Insider long ago mainly because of their mobile web capabilities. During this time we've launched a lot of different campaigns and used different products. I can highlite Insider's web push product. Very simple, but very profitable.

This was incredibly useful as we were able to execute campaigns much faster and more seamlessly. A huge plus point was the flexibility to edit any parts of our campaigns anytime as well, without requesting for the support of other teams.\n\nI appreciated the range of campaigns and templates available for our choosing. However, the primary feature I love about using Insider is the great customer support I've experienced so far. From answering small questions (like how to utilise some design features) to brainstorming for larger solutions - I could always count on Insider to be there for me.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Insider?\nThe backend setup itself can be cumbersome and not the most intuitive.

All of this is possible because insider's segmentation tools are effective at tracking onsite behavior and segmenting users based on their preferences.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Insider?\nWe've observed a few bugs related to production at times, but we've never had to face any delays on account of these.\n\nWhat problems is Insider solving and how is that benefiting you?\nBefore we started using Insider, our tech-stack was spread across different tools and there was no real-time data integration between our various marketing efforts since these tools operated in silos. It was also a big challenge for us to drive meaningful omnichannel experiences as there was no single platform from where we could orchestrate holistic customer journeys.
