Words are large, navigation is easy, colors are lovely and unique. The helpdesk is very responsive and oh so patient for those of us who are still learning the system.

It doesn't REALLY matter much however I am unable to access that email address... (it is linked to a domain I own ) so I cannot see if people try to reply. I remedy this by putting a different email address in my signature.

This way my list is always fresh. Another benefit (which I don't use but I think is excellent) is there is the option of using ready-made template designs with images for a more catchy email. I don't use it only because I use text-only emails with the specific purposes of my autoresponder needs.

Words are large, navigation is easy, colors are lovely and unique. The helpdesk is very responsive and oh so patient for those of us who are still learning the system.

It is simple, yet gives you many options for specificity if needed.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Sendlane?\nUm... the only thing I dislike is that I am unable to change the email address that I originally signed up with due to several factors. It doesn't REALLY matter much however I am unable to access that email address... (it is linked to a domain I own ) so I cannot see if people try to reply. I remedy this by putting a different email address in my signature. It's really a personal problem, not necessarily a problem with the app.\n\nWhat problems is Sendlane solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThe two biggest problems I have been able to solve with Sendlane is with easily scheduling future emails (and specifying groups &/or sub-groups/segments that receive it) and scheduling the contact clean-up that happens on a regular basis so that non-responsible members are automatically removed after a certain period of time. This way my list is always fresh. Another benefit (which I don't use but I think is excellent) is there is the option of using ready-made template designs with images for a more catchy email. I don't use it only because I use text-only emails with the specific purposes of my autoresponder needs.

It's very easy to get started, if you're new to email service providers, or moving over from another one, you'll definitely be pleased with how easy it is to get started.  The customer support is the best I've ever seen on any email platform, and believe me, I've used a lot of them.\n\nAnother feature I really like, is how it will give you the ability to do automatic list hygiene.
