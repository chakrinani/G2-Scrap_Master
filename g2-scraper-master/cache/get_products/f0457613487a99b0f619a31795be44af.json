There are also loads of integrations to do things like, eg. add a lead to a Facebook audience after they have clicked a link on your website. Encharge is also very flexible. Other tools I have tried make it difficult to use multiple domains and multiple email addresses. The process is very simple in Encharge. One thing that has been really good for us is the 'sub-accounts', since we run a number of different websites for ourselves and for clients. We use sub-accounts to keep these all nice and separate.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Encharge?\nThe onboarding and training process could be a little smoother.

If you're looking to automate your emails into long and complex flows, then you've found it with Encharge. I've been using ActiveCampaign, exclusively, for years. There are 3 things I love about it: the ability to tag, segment, and blast emails based on behaviour; their simple-to-use drag-and-drop builder; and their deliverability rates.\n\nEncharge definitely checks two of 2 of these 3 boxes. They have a great drag-and-drop builder with everything you need to customize the exact look of your emails. Plus, they have a flow builder that has more integrations and just as many (if not more) possibilities as ActiveCampaign's automation builder.\n\nUsing the app is intuitive and easy to learn. It looks great too!\n\nEncharge looks to be making a charge for ActiveCampaign in the email automation space. Their support is amazing, even better than what you get with ActiveCampaign. As long as their emails keep hitting the inbox, I'll be moving myself, my clients, and all of my future clients from ActiveCampaign to Encharge.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Encharge?\nThere are some things I hope they'll add to stay on par with--and one day surpass--ActiveCampaign. Adding the ability to copy multiple steps of a flow would be great, and it sounds like they're working on it already. Being able to move users stuck at a step into another step manually would be very helpful. Finally, SMS is a must to truly compete with ActiveCampaing. So far, their pricing is only slightly less than ActiveCampaign's--I hope it's enough to sway current AC users to try something new.\n\nNow, Encharge checks 2 of the 3 boxes mentioned earlier, but their deliverability is still an unknown. Some of their onboarding emails were going straight to my junk/spam folder. This is a particular issue for Microsoft receiving accounts like Hotmail or Outlook. I know ActiveCampaign has had issues with this, but they were always quick to find a fix. Encharge said they were working on it, and ever since, their emails have been hitting my inbox! This is crucial. Without high deliverability rates, the platform will fail. So, I hope they make this a major, ongoing priority.\n\nWhat problems is Encharge solving and how is that benefiting you?\nEmail Automation at a competitive price", "review_question_answers": [{"question": "What do you like best about Encharge?", "answer": "Encharge is one of the first viable alternatives to ActiveCampaign that I've come across. If you're looking to automate your emails into long and complex flows, then you've found it with Encharge. I've been using ActiveCampaign, exclusively, for years. There are 3 things I love about it: the ability to tag, segment, and blast emails based on behaviour; their simple-to-use drag-and-drop builder; and their deliverability rates.\n\nEncharge definitely checks two of 2 of these 3 boxes. They have a great drag-and-drop builder with everything you need to customize the exact look of your emails. Plus, they have a flow builder that has more integrations and just as many (if not more) possibilities as ActiveCampaign's automation builder.\n\nUsing the app is intuitive and easy to learn. It looks great too!\n\nEncharge looks to be making a charge for ActiveCampaign in the email automation space. Their support is amazing, even better than what you get with ActiveCampaign. As long as their emails keep hitting the inbox, I'll be moving myself, my clients, and all of my future clients from ActiveCampaign to Encharge."}, {"question": "What do you dislike about Encharge?", "answer": "There are some things I hope they'll add to stay on par with--and one day surpass--ActiveCampaign. Adding the ability to copy multiple steps of a flow would be great, and it sounds like they're working on it already. Being able to move users stuck at a step into another step manually would be very helpful. Finally, SMS is a must to truly compete with ActiveCampaing. So far, their pricing is only slightly less than ActiveCampaign's--I hope it's enough to sway current AC users to try something new.\n\nNow, Encharge checks 2 of the 3 boxes mentioned earlier, but their deliverability is still an unknown. Some of their onboarding emails were going straight to my junk/spam folder. This is a particular issue for Microsoft receiving accounts like Hotmail or Outlook. I know ActiveCampaign has had issues with this, but they were always quick to find a fix. Encharge said they were working on it, and ever since, their emails have been hitting my inbox!
