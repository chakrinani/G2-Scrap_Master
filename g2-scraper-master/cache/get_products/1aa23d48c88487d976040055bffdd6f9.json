The customer service/support of ConnectWise has gone straight to the crapper since ConnectWise was sold, in the days of the older ownership, support was great, the product actually worked correctly. Now it takes a act of congress to get anything to happen and it takes a week or two to get anything resolved. We had issues where the ConnectWise mail filters have blocked our internal email and external for clients, to technicians not being able to submit time all because of changes these mental midget make to the systems and then they blame you for the mistakes they make. I've spent hours on the chat re inventing the wheel on our end, just to find out that the issues was inside their data base. We have technician in the field, ConnectWise does an update and none of our mobile apps work any longer, their solution just uninstall and re installed the app, it will fix it. Well, number one these are field technicians they don't typically have the time to do this during the field appointments. Number two, when they did this it didn't fix the issue and now we wait for the non existent support from ConnectWise.

As other reviewers have commented, Sales promised the moon but the actual system does not do what we were told, and the effort required from us has been substantial. For example, we were told that importing our extensive contact list would take minutes. It literally took three months of work, because our list had to be scrubbed and cleansed and revised to match their system's requirements, and each record had to be individually edited to enable assignment of basic market differentiators.\n\nAlso their support is slow and indifferent and tends to default to blaming either your workstation or user error before learning much about the actual issue. The chat function on the website is useless as the chat operators simply don't know enough about how the system works to answer questions or direct you to the correct documentation. As others mentioned, there are often five different ways to do the same thing and no way to evaluate if one way is better than another. Some of their logic is a bit crazy - for example, you can generate a report of \"hours worked by work type\" over time, but the report groups all hours into the first month the ticket was open! So if your ticket was open for several months, the time worked is all in the first month. The custom reporting function is arduous to learn to use.\n\nThey have a lot of training materials but they are difficult to navigate or search. I've spent an hour hunting down the answer to a simple question after the chat operator didn't know. The training itself does not weight the scoring of test questions according to the value of the information and is not geared towards real-world use of the system. It also contains many factual errors - after our purchase, I was told they knew these materials needed to be rewritten.\n\nThe biggest issue for us is that we're outside of their core client base of MSPs and were told repeatedly in the Sales process that this was not an issue and the system could be easily customized to our needs. After purchase, we found that that was not the case by a long shot. I suspect that ConnectWise may be an acceptable solution for MSPs. If you do exactly what the system is built for and don't need any custom functionality, your experience would probably be better than ours. I absolutely would NOT recommend them to anyone else.
