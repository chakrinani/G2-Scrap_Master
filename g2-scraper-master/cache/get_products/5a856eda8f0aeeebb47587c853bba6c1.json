The filter system prevents bad reviews from being posted and encourages good reviews to be shared. Signpost is divided into 4 features: feedback/review emails, loyalty, new customer, and SMS messaging. It's an extremely effective means of keeping in touch with customers, both manually and automatically.

I want to provide them with the automated reporting, but I don't want them going to the dashboard and changing everything.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Signpost:\nThey are currently expanding their product to be more agency-friendly. So, if you're an agency like us, it'll likely become an even better product.\n\nWhat problems is Signpost solving and how is that benefiting you?\nWe have several clients that were in desperate need of reviews and were asking for a solution.
