I've worked on teams where I managed many people under me before, and I still work with an amazing team of people but after properly configuring Shape I'm able to get as much done with just me + Shape's automation as I've been able to do with many assistants before.\n\nProspecting: We can import massive lists of prospects and we run e-mail text and phone campaigns with all prospects automatically.  We can easily take notes after each contact or contact attempt (I don't even type I just use their voicenote feature) and best of all there are automated e-mails and texts that go out after each contact attempt.  For example after a call if a prospect doesn't answer an automatic e-mail and text is sent out from my system.

We can easily take notes after each contact or contact attempt (I don't even type I just use their voicenote feature) and best of all there are automated e-mails and texts that go out after each contact attempt.  For example after a call if a prospect doesn't answer an automatic e-mail and text is sent out from my system.  There's also a voicemail drop feature which saves us hours, anytime I call and someone doesn't answer I just push a button and a voicemail is left for them.\nOrganization: My calendar is synced, their mobile app notifies me of everything, and the task management and project management features allow me and everyone to work out of one centralized place.\nReporting: It looks like there are 100+ pre-built reports but I honestly have no idea how many there are (we just use the call reports and email reports, we don't really use the others yet).\n\nMy favorite thing, which probably isn't a big deal, is their call recording feature.
