visited your website, it would sometimes show exact people who rolled around the website and would connect this with Google Analytics data to show which pages they visited and how long they stayed for, where they converted (if converted) etc. This gives one a card blanche to go after these folks - I would connect with them on LinkedIn, reach out with the message and close them for a call.

visited your website, it would sometimes show exact people who rolled around the website and would connect this with Google Analytics data to show which pages they visited and how long they stayed for, where they converted (if converted) etc. This gives one a card blanche to go after these folks - I would connect with them on LinkedIn, reach out with the message and close them for a call.
