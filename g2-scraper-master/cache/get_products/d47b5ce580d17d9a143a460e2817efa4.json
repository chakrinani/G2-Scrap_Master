What I like best is that you can create a campaign all inside of Omnisend only that will use your Shopify data to create it. There are different parameters and automation that you can put in place and once it is in place it is only a matter of maintenance to make sure things are running fully.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Omnisend?\nI dislike that there is a bit of a learning curve to get things set up. There is a lot of trial and error to make sure that you are doing things correctly and efficiently. It also seems like a big app that is very powerful but learning all the many things it can do can take some time to get the hang of it.\n\nWhat problems is Omnisend solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThe problem that Omnisend solves is really taking the reigns on marketing. Although it may take a bit to get the hang of things, the app builders have thought of everything with this.

The Product Picker is a great feature which allows you to pick the products to add to the email directly form the website. A bit slow sometimes in loading but it works well and saves time.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Omnisend?\nPrices increase too much when you start scaling the business. The natural growth of your mailing list will bring you to price tiers which, in my opinion, are a bit too expensive. Triggers and workflows in-out mechanisms are not easy to use. We realized after a couple of months that some of the workflows were not working correctly as the setup hadn't been done properly - but it was pretty hard, even with the Omnisend support team, to understand what we should have done instead of what we had done.\nThere are now few pre-built audience segmentations, but we still haven't found them helpful - I'd like to see more AI recommendations and segmentation in place.\n\nWhat problems is Omnisend solving and how is that benefiting you?\nEmail marketing automation. The available pre-built email marketing automation workflows are fantastic. We have quickly built welcome, abandoned cart, onboarding, cross-sales, reactivation workflows and many more in a relatively short amount of time. Some of them are basic though, and we had to spend time customizing and improving. Email designs also are somewhat limited. Generally speaking, the available pre-made designs are good but we could use thematic designs for the campaigns (for example, more Christmas, Valentines', Black Fridays templates etc).

The line-height, spacing, text choices, etc. that are canned do require a lot of changes and only some of the modules available in the editor allow you to save them for future use.

It is simple to set up and the prompts to move you from one campaign to another and further the development of your business is effortless and very helpful for a newbie like myself"}, {"question": "What do you dislike about Omnisend?", "answer": "I didn't like getting the rug pulled out on the \"paid features\" after the trial. I was barely started, it took me time to create them, and they were ended with a prompt to pay. I wasn't aware this was going to happen and I was soured on your company as a result. I spent a week telling people about how great your app was, how it was going to help my business grow, and how the service turns to paid features at scale. I have moved to a paid account now. I sill like the intuitive design and ease of use."}, {"question": "Recommendations to others considering Omnisend:", "answer": "Paid features are worth it if you are to scale, otherwise use other free services (if available on your sales platform) to get you there. Omnisend is very user friendly and the design is intuitive. Free features are limited compared to others in the industry, but paid features and UI are superior."}, {"question": "What problems is Omnisend solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "I'm a one person team trying to get this up and running. The professional templates and atomization are a huge help to get me to a point where I could justify paying for your service. I tried to switch to MailChimp just as Shopify was dropping their integration with them, so I had to return to Omnisend. I'm overall satisfied with their product, just wish they had a longer runway for start-ups to gain a following and begin paying only once they reached scale."}], "review_rating": 3.5, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "Cory F.", "reviewer_job_title": "Owner/Founder", "reviewer_link": "https://www.g2.com/users/dd233075-5431-408b-97fd-83e27b70e232"}, "publish_date": "2020-05-30T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Small-Business(50 or fewer emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/omnisend/reviews/omnisend-review-1355483"}, {"review_id": 4459394, "review_title": "Great product.

Even the information that it is able to pull cannot be used as part of segmentation to send personalised email to your database. What I found most surprising and disappointing was it doesn't even pull in the correct Order Numbers into the email. It creates its own order number which is different from the order number in Shopify so even trying to use it's Order Confirmation workflow is useless when it inserts order numbers into the email that is different to the order number in Shopify.  Sadly I will have to find another marketing automation software that is suited for eCommerce businesses."}, {"question": "Recommendations to others considering Omnisend:", "answer": "Not ideal if you're an eCommerce business and if you require customer information and order information to be integrated correctly.
