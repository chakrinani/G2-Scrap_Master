Our customers were requesting for a preference management solution so they could unsubscribe from notifications they didn't find important. There were also requests for sending a few notifications immediately and others as digests. SuprSend's inbox notifications along with preference management system provided us with a quick go-to-market solution without writing code. We compared SuprSend with other tools, and some of them were missing multi-tenant notification preferences, and others were providing only APIs, we fould only SuprSend's solution to be complete.\n\nWhat do you dislike about SuprSend?\nNothing as such, we got things delivered as promised.
