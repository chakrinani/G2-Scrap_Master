They provide multichannel messaging with personalization and cross-channel orchestration capabilities. We are also able to leverage experimentation features frequently while launching brand-new campaigns. It's easy to distribute messages to multiple/desired channels within the same campaign.\nI also like the intelligent timing and intelligent channel targeting features. This helps us to optimize when to send a message to a user and through which channel. Both features help us to achieve the user engagement goals with our messaging.\nThey also improve their product constantly by adding roadmap items coming as requests from their customers. We still have regular check-ins with their team to discuss our additional needs. It's good to see that our requests are being enabled within the product over time.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Braze?\nComplex multichannel campaign management UI caused marketers to have difficulties setting up campaigns and monitoring campaign health through canvasses in the past. Even though canvases look like a perfect solution to manage everything in a user flow, the UI led marketers to ask for engineering help to validate campaign data often. Since the team has been using the product for a long time, we have figured out internal policies to reduce this operational effort, also once people get used to it the additional requests are reduced over time.

We have been using it for the last 2,5 years for cross-channel messaging activities. We started to use it with only D2C email and mobile push messaging, then extended it to B2B messaging and additional channels easily. Because Braze allows us to experiment with new ideas effectively and improve our marketing capabilities with a widely integrated solution.\nEven though we have had issues with operational usage along the way and don't find it 100% user-friendly, we could resolve all the problems that led us to choose this product in the first place.", "review_question_answers": [{"question": "What do you like best about Braze?", "answer": "The main reason for us to drive through Braze was the comprehensive cross-channel personalization ability. They provide multichannel messaging with personalization and cross-channel orchestration capabilities. We are also able to leverage experimentation features frequently while launching brand-new campaigns. It's easy to distribute messages to multiple/desired channels within the same campaign.\nI also like the intelligent timing and intelligent channel targeting features. This helps us to optimize when to send a message to a user and through which channel. Both features help us to achieve the user engagement goals with our messaging.\nThey also improve their product constantly by adding roadmap items coming as requests from their customers. We still have regular check-ins with their team to discuss our additional needs. It's good to see that our requests are being enabled within the product over time."}, {"question": "What do you dislike about Braze?", "answer": "Complex multichannel campaign management UI caused marketers to have difficulties setting up campaigns and monitoring campaign health through canvasses in the past. Even though canvases look like a perfect solution to manage everything in a user flow, the UI led marketers to ask for engineering help to validate campaign data often. Since the team has been using the product for a long time, we have figured out internal policies to reduce this operational effort, also once people get used to it the additional requests are reduced over time. I think clear guides and comprehensive campaign reporting would help reduce these operational issues."}, {"question": "What problems is Braze solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "Braze is powerful in managing campaigns across different channels with comprehensive personalization abilities.

Further, doing so means we can give the experiences a cohesive management system at the same time, and every additional data point offloaded broadens our options for messaging.

As with most templating languages, the error tracing/debugging is minimal to nonexistent -- designing things to \"fail silently\" when issues are encountered, while best for \"live\" messaging, can be problematic for those of us trying to figure out where issues originate.\nWe have encountered some other speedbumps with Braze, but this is one of the few that wasn't being specifically addressed in ongoing improvements or for which an alternate solution was available."}, {"question": "What problems is Braze solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "Braze is helping us modernize and streamline communications with our users. We can now convert what were once complex email and SMS experiences, previously orchestrated across multiple vendors and internal databases, into a form that allows us to offload tremendous amounts of data manipulation and retention to Braze's systems. Further, doing so means we can give the experiences a cohesive management system at the same time, and every additional data point offloaded broadens our options for messaging. Braze enabled us to branch into mobile notifications easily, and soon we're hoping to integrate site experiences as well, allowing us to reach our users in a more adaptable, holistic fashion without having to do all the heavy lifting ourselves via internal systems."}], "review_rating": 4.5, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "Jason M.", "reviewer_job_title": "NOT GIVEN", "reviewer_link": "https://www.g2.com/users/84eae4c9-baac-4201-b14d-159821405c5c"}, "publish_date": "2023-04-11T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Mid-Market(51-1000 emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/braze/reviews/braze-review-7934715"}, {"review_id": 8735910, "review_title": "Phenomenal Service - Can't Recommend More!", "review_content": "What do you like best about Braze?\nBraze allows us to reach millions of our subscribers efficently and reliably.

and different regions.\nThe support team has been very helpful with identifying issues and offering guidance on setup issues as well.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Braze?\nThere are a lot of unexplained sending issues that we've experienced with SMS and email.\n\nThere are a lot of functions that show even if we don't have data stored for those attributes. It would be nice if those would not show if we don't have data for the function setup. For example, if local timezone data isn't something we specifically have, it shouldn't show at all.\n\nThe revenue shown from each campaign doesn't seem entirely accurate. It would be great if there was a visualization of where the revenue is coming from and when for each campaign.\n\nFor users with limited access, it would be great if only the things they have access to show. For example, we only want franchisees to be able to draft messages, but they can still get lost in other tabs causing lots of confusion.\n\nOverall, the process of setting up Braze to a point where we can actually use it was not what we expected.

For example, if local timezone data isn't something we specifically have, it shouldn't show at all.\n\nThe revenue shown from each campaign doesn't seem entirely accurate. It would be great if there was a visualization of where the revenue is coming from and when for each campaign.\n\nFor users with limited access, it would be great if only the things they have access to show. For example, we only want franchisees to be able to draft messages, but they can still get lost in other tabs causing lots of confusion.\n\nOverall, the process of setting up Braze to a point where we can actually use it was not what we expected. I think letting future clients know what the setup time for each messaging channel is (i.e. 2 months for SMS, 5 months for push, 8 months for email, etc) would be super helpful for gauging when to make changes to internal processes and systems."}, {"question": "What problems is Braze solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "Braze has helped us send a variety of messages targetting segmented audiences, which has helped lower opt-out rates and increase conversions.

It is very user-friendly, and even if you are a first-time user of a CRM tool, you can make anything from one-shot campaigns to multiple-step canvas in different channels, decision splits, and webhooks.\n\nBraze helps accompany the user through the customer journey. You can set up as many sets of communications as you want for each life cycle stage: Activation (onboarding), Retention (loyalty and frequency), and Reengagement (churn). Plus, it gives marketing teams autonomy to create their segmentation and personalization without depending on other departments.\n\nMoreover, every month Braze launches new features that improve the capability of the tool. From intelligent channels and timings (so you can target the users in their most engaged channel at the right time) to survey in-apps and audience paths (which allows sending each user communications based on their behavior).\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that the support team is excellent. Whenever I have a question, an issue, or an idea, the support team responds quickly.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Braze?\nThere are two downsides to Braze: First, reporting is poor compared to the rest of the capabilities. It is not user-friendly and lacks organization to drive insightful conversations. Second, once the canvas is live, if there is a last-minute change, you might not be able to increase the proportion of the control group or apply some changes on the channel steps.\n\nWhat problems is Braze solving and how is that benefiting you?\nBraze has allowed us to build a robust strategy for each one of the stages of the user.

It is very user-friendly, and even if you are a first-time user of a CRM tool, you can make anything from one-shot campaigns to multiple-step canvas in different channels, decision splits, and webhooks.\n\nBraze helps accompany the user through the customer journey. You can set up as many sets of communications as you want for each life cycle stage: Activation (onboarding), Retention (loyalty and frequency), and Reengagement (churn). Plus, it gives marketing teams autonomy to create their segmentation and personalization without depending on other departments.\n\nMoreover, every month Braze launches new features that improve the capability of the tool. From intelligent channels and timings (so you can target the users in their most engaged channel at the right time) to survey in-apps and audience paths (which allows sending each user communications based on their behavior).\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that the support team is excellent. Whenever I have a question, an issue, or an idea, the support team responds quickly."}, {"question": "What do you dislike about Braze?", "answer": "There are two downsides to Braze: First, reporting is poor compared to the rest of the capabilities. It is not user-friendly and lacks organization to drive insightful conversations.
