It suits both beginners and experienced users perfectly. The entire amount of options and functionalities work very intuitively. The way you think it will work is how it works pretty much all the time. That makes it an easy-to-use piece of software for beginners, but it also fulfills all desires and needs for the more experienced user like myself. Easily create campaign flows, emails and landing pages based on templates using drag-and-drop. Anyone can create beautiful emails, landing pages and campaign flows. And if you're ready to dive into the code yourself, you can go all out in creating templates and custom objects using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Smarty and more. Deployteq also comes with a huge amount of possible extensions that can mostly be installed within one minute. And if you're having questions or trouble getting something done, they also have customer support available in Dutch (and, of course, in English). And if you have a feature request, there's a short line to the development team as they develop their software in-house. They also offer training programs in order to get you off to a flying start using Deployteq. And if you don't want to do the actual work yourself in the end, you can also hire their Campaign Services team to do everything for you. They truly offer the complete package.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Deployteq?\nThere's not a lot to dislike. If I have to name one thing, maybe the speed of the database when uploading loads of records. Although most marketing software packages have this struggle, it would be nice if uploading 300.000 or more records would take less time. It can now take about an hour, which is not unacceptable but could be improved upon.\n\nWhat problems is Deployteq solving and how is that benefiting you?\nDeployteq helps me out in numerous ways. I handle most of my email marketing activities there, but also marketing automation, personalization, omnichannel communication to other channels, data quality management and more. We even use the landing page functionality to create MVP's to validate future functionalities, improvements and expansions for our website.

It suits both beginners and experienced users perfectly. The entire amount of options and functionalities work very intuitively. The way you think it will work is how it works pretty much all the time. That makes it an easy-to-use piece of software for beginners, but it also fulfills all desires and needs for the more experienced user like myself. Easily create campaign flows, emails and landing pages based on templates using drag-and-drop. Anyone can create beautiful emails, landing pages and campaign flows. And if you're ready to dive into the code yourself, you can go all out in creating templates and custom objects using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Smarty and more. Deployteq also comes with a huge amount of possible extensions that can mostly be installed within one minute. And if you're having questions or trouble getting something done, they also have customer support available in Dutch (and, of course, in English). And if you have a feature request, there's a short line to the development team as they develop their software in-house. They also offer training programs in order to get you off to a flying start using Deployteq. And if you don't want to do the actual work yourself in the end, you can also hire their Campaign Services team to do everything for you. They truly offer the complete package.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Deployteq?\nThere's not a lot to dislike. If I have to name one thing, maybe the speed of the database when uploading loads of records. Although most marketing software packages have this struggle, it would be nice if uploading 300.000 or more records would take less time. It can now take about an hour, which is not unacceptable but could be improved upon.\n\nWhat problems is Deployteq solving and how is that benefiting you?\nDeployteq helps me out in numerous ways. I handle most of my email marketing activities there, but also marketing automation, personalization, omnichannel communication to other channels, data quality management and more. We even use the landing page functionality to create MVP's to validate future functionalities, improvements and expansions for our website. It also offers easy to configure webhooks so that you can quickly connect other software to Deployteq using an API-connection.
