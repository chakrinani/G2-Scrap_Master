We can see what our customers browse, search for and click on our website, as well as their activity in our retail stores. This data helps us build precise segments with very specific conditions, meaning we can send highly targeted campaigns that customers find useful and respond well to. And speaking of campaigns, the platform has lots to choose from - whether we need to create a complex communication sequence (such as after an abandoned cart or browse) or send out manual campaigns.\n\nMindbox is perfect for teams like us that love having numbers to work with. We make all our decisions based on the concrete facts and figures that we get from reports, removing the need for any guesswork. We use these numbers with the inbuilt A/B tests to verify our hypotheses and improve metrics like our click rate or open rate.\n\nWe also like the transparent pricing approach, as it helps us plan our budget, keep our costs predictable, and understand how much we're spending on each channel.\nFinally, the support team is fantastic and saves us a lot of time. Our account manager is always there to help us with our tasks or help us analyze our results and generate new ideas.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Maestra?\nIt was hard for us to find a CRM marketer that knows how to work with Mindbox and really understands the platform's capabilities. I had to spend some time training one of our team members and this involved quite a steep learning curve - we found that there weren't enough training materials or ways of assessing how much progress we'd made.

We can see what our customers browse, search for and click on our website, as well as their activity in our retail stores. This data helps us build precise segments with very specific conditions, meaning we can send highly targeted campaigns that customers find useful and respond well to. And speaking of campaigns, the platform has lots to choose from - whether we need to create a complex communication sequence (such as after an abandoned cart or browse) or send out manual campaigns.\n\nMindbox is perfect for teams like us that love having numbers to work with. We make all our decisions based on the concrete facts and figures that we get from reports, removing the need for any guesswork. We use these numbers with the inbuilt A/B tests to verify our hypotheses and improve metrics like our click rate or open rate.\n\nWe also like the transparent pricing approach, as it helps us plan our budget, keep our costs predictable, and understand how much we're spending on each channel.\nFinally, the support team is fantastic and saves us a lot of time. Our account manager is always there to help us with our tasks or help us analyze our results and generate new ideas.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Maestra?\nIt was hard for us to find a CRM marketer that knows how to work with Mindbox and really understands the platform's capabilities. I had to spend some time training one of our team members and this involved quite a steep learning curve - we found that there weren't enough training materials or ways of assessing how much progress we'd made. It would be great if Mindbox could help with this in some way. I believe that it would also be useful for other companies that are in the same kind of situation as us.\n\nThis also leads me on to my next point - in order to start seeing tangible results and benefits, you'll need to get to know the platform and what it can in a lot of detail. And as I just mentioned, this can be a pretty slow process.\n\nThe pop-ups could also be improved. We've had a number of difficulties when trying to launch them, as the interface in this part of the platform is not very intuitive - it can take  a lot of time to configure the design elements.\n\nWhat problems is Maestra solving and how is that benefiting you?\nOur main goal with Mindbox was to increase the revenue generated by our email marketing. Over the course of a year, our email marketing revenue share has increased from 3.7% to 8.8%, and we've made a 550% ROI.\n\nWe've automated a lot of our communications, including the welcome email series, product recommendation emails, lots of abandoned browse emails (such as abandoned view and cart, to name a few), as well as many other campaigns.

But Mindbox is very cheap for big companies.\n* Mindbox is not a regular ESP, so some basic things can be very complicated at the first glance. But when you dive into it, you will understand that complexity comes with a great flexibility.\n* Sometimes interface and segmentations don't work fast. Maybe because we have a very big customer base with millions users and several hundreds of actions stored.\n* ML features are quite weak yet, but Mindbox manager allowed us to test them for free :)"}, {"question": "What problems is Maestra solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "* CRM marketing -- we leveled up our email and push channels.\n* Product recommendations -- cross-sell and up-sell mechanics helped to raise AOV.\n* Loyalty features -- scanning rate in retail grew from 7% to almost 60%.\n* Promotions and popups can be launched by marketing team without developers' involvement."}], "review_rating": 5.0, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "Stanislav S.", "reviewer_job_title": "CRM Manager", "reviewer_link": "https://www.g2.com/users/55acf9aa-fb6a-4a8c-a06e-e78396fa178d"}, "publish_date": "2022-07-27T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Enterprise(> 1000 emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/maestraplatform/reviews/maestra-review-6902546"}, {"review_id": 6937707, "review_title": "A Flexible Marketing Automation Tool", "review_content": "What do you like best about Maestra?\nI've been using Mindbox while working in SaaS MarTech & EdTech, and I was surprised by its flexibility: I was able to customize Mindbox for our subscription model and adopt its product architecture for our students' learning processes.
