It can add contacts based solely on IP, and make the connection once they fill out a form. This is great because it allows you to see what a potential customer has been doing since before they even contacted you. For example, you can tell that this was the fourth time they visited your website in the last week.\n\nOnce you know they're interested, you can use pre-created campaigns to send drip marketing emails to them on a particular interval. This seems to be the hot new thing right now, right?\n\nWhat do you dislike about Acquia Customer Data Platform?\nWe opted for the self-hosted version. This took some know-how to set up properly, and the follow up drip-marketing they sent us for getting started didn't totally match up with what we saw. This was confusing. Their documentation could use some help.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Acquia Customer Data Platform:\nIf you know what you're doing, the set up isn't bad.

It can add contacts based solely on IP, and make the connection once they fill out a form. This is great because it allows you to see what a potential customer has been doing since before they even contacted you. For example, you can tell that this was the fourth time they visited your website in the last week.\n\nOnce you know they're interested, you can use pre-created campaigns to send drip marketing emails to them on a particular interval.
