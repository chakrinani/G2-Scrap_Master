It is a must-have for every e-commerce platform since it can help generate really good revenue with its marketing tools and campaigns. The customer feedback is really great. I had some initial issues and the customer support was on its toes to help me out.\n\n2. The categorization of the platform is top-notch. it categorised various categories like potential sales, engaged subscribers and more into subcategories which made the dashboard appear clean.\n\n3. By building a comprehensive customer database that contains the customer's profile and other related details, helps my team to target potential customers. Based on the customer's behaviours, I sought to reach out to them with a personalized message.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Klaviyo?\n1. One of the shortcomings I faced was that while creating a sequence I had issues with the automation of the campaigns which somehow broke the flow of marketing.\n\n2. The learning curve of the platform is really steep. Before using the platform seamlessly and getting effective data outputs for analysis, I had spent good enough time understanding the platform by going through different videos and document files related to it.\n\n3. One of the important features of Klaviyo is text message sending, but I found its functioning and performance are not up to the team's expectations.\n\nWhat problems is Klaviyo solving and how is that benefiting you?\nKlaviyo is one of the best and most advanced targeting and marketing campaign platforms for different levels of enterprises.

August 3rd, 2022 we found out sensistive account information was accessed and Klaviyo was hacked. Their CEO put out a message, but instead of actually responding to customers, they just have a customer service representative say \"We are sorry.\" Just like the BP oil spill, they are just sorry that they got into trouble and caught.

The data collected allows for advanced segmentation so that newsletters and flows can be narrowed to convert. If you're not familiar with customizing dynamic data via API, there is a bit of a learning curve.

You can also access their design library, which has lots of templates to start from. Once you customize one of these with your branding, then you can save that template for future use. We've built 3 templates that we use on a regular basis - receipts, monthly specials, and new product announcements.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Klaviyo?\nWoocommerce integration isn't intuitive. We came from a system that had built-in receipts for transactions, shipping details, etc. These flows had to be built out manually using the API integration. This took me several weeks to figure out and despite having an account that we're paying nearly $5000 annually for, support was not super forthcoming with details, mainly referring to their KB. If I had more experience with API dev, the KB would likely be more than enough to solve my issue. But, I had zero experience with making these types of calls and even with the preview system, crafting the right snippet of code was problematic and set me back several times.\n\nAlso, this may only be with Wordpress, but our previous system integrated natively with WooCommerce's coupon system, Klaviyo does not.

When first starting out I had no clue what I was doing. I really appreciated that they had all the basic emails already outlined for me. It made it so much easier for me.  It's easy to use, easy to integrate and provides awesome functionalities that any eCommerce store could need. Their automated flows (abandoned carts, thank you emails, welcome series) all work seamlessly. Another reason to love Klaviyo is their ability to segment your audience. It's so easy to segment your audience based on their activity and interaction with your website.  I have been able to create sophisticated flows with minimal stress and effort. For example, creating segments of customers who purchased product X but didn't purchase product Y, or customers who viewed a certain product page but didn't make a purchase.

When first starting out I had no clue what I was doing. I really appreciated that they had all the basic emails already outlined for me. It made it so much easier for me.  It's easy to use, easy to integrate and provides awesome functionalities that any eCommerce store could need. Their automated flows (abandoned carts, thank you emails, welcome series) all work seamlessly. Another reason to love Klaviyo is their ability to segment your audience. It's so easy to segment your audience based on their activity and interaction with your website.  I have been able to create sophisticated flows with minimal stress and effort. For example, creating segments of customers who purchased product X but didn't purchase product Y, or customers who viewed a certain product page but didn't make a purchase. By having these segments you can send very targeted emails to them, upping conversion rate and the ability to sync custom audiences to Facebook.

I love that it offers an amazing degree of analytics and data to help us offer the most personalized experience through email marketing and on our website. Plus, it integrates with our most important platforms. But what I really love most is the Klaviyo team itself. I have never met more customer oriented and helpful people in my life. They care about you and are so helpful with anything you need on the Klaviyo platform or really just e-mail marketing in general. The platform is amazing, but ultimately it's the PEOPLE that really make Klaviyo worth it to me day in and day out!\n\nWhat do you dislike about Klaviyo?\nI don't have many downsides to Klaviyo. I guess I would like to see more options to analyze and review the data from their platform. Something like Google Data Studio? I'm a data nerd, and I love having all of it in one place for me to play with and visualize when communicating it to my team. I would also like to see a little more support for transactional emails. We tried transactional emails with Klaviyo to replace Shopify's, but unfortunately they would not send to people who were unsubscribed from marketing, which does not work for emails that notify you about shipping or orders.

I love that it offers an amazing degree of analytics and data to help us offer the most personalized experience through email marketing and on our website. Plus, it integrates with our most important platforms. But what I really love most is the Klaviyo team itself. I have never met more customer oriented and helpful people in my life. They care about you and are so helpful with anything you need on the Klaviyo platform or really just e-mail marketing in general. The platform is amazing, but ultimately it's the PEOPLE that really make Klaviyo worth it to me day in and day out!"}, {"question": "What do you dislike about Klaviyo?", "answer": "I don't have many downsides to Klaviyo. I guess I would like to see more options to analyze and review the data from their platform. Something like Google Data Studio? I'm a data nerd, and I love having all of it in one place for me to play with and visualize when communicating it to my team. I would also like to see a little more support for transactional emails. We tried transactional emails with Klaviyo to replace Shopify's, but unfortunately they would not send to people who were unsubscribed from marketing, which does not work for emails that notify you about shipping or orders.

It has a built in integration with Shopify and Facebook, allowing a seamless omnichannel approach to digital marketing strategies. It is super user friendly and I love the automation flows we're able to set up without much manual involvement. We've been able to attribute 48% of online sales to email automations and campaigns.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Klaviyo?\nNot much! I think it is a good bang for your buck. It's worth cleaning up your list and focus marketing comms on current customers that have purchased within the last 12 months so these people will be less likely to report spam and more likely to engage. Having a smaller, more engaged list is cheaper and marketing efforts are more effective. What is cool is that you don't have to pay anything to sign up. You start paying by list size the moment you start sending emails, so the transition from another email marketing software is seamless as you can build flows, automations, and import your list.\n\nWhat problems is Klaviyo solving and how is that benefiting you?\nBeing able to dial in to current customers as personas, rather than generalizations has been super effective in developing specific targeted flows.

Especially that you can build filters around specific customer engagement points (aka - find all customers that have ordered in the past but have not ordered in the last 60 days) then automatically send emails to that segment of customers on a scheduled basis.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Klaviyo?\n- Wish it integrated with Drupal Commerce out of the box. Would use Klaviyo for those projects as well.\n- This is more of a Shopify issue, but we save customer information in MetaFields that are filled out during the checkout process. I wish we could (easily) push that data into Klaviyo as well. Really have to stretch to find disappointing things about this system, though.\n- Wish that the auto responder emails went out faster. For instance, if a user signs up for a coupon, I'd like them to receive an email with the coupon code within minutes. Right now it takes an hour (+/-)\n\nRecommendations to others considering Klaviyo:\nIf you are using Shopify, it's a no brainer.

Would use Klaviyo for those projects as well.\n- This is more of a Shopify issue, but we save customer information in MetaFields that are filled out during the checkout process. I wish we could (easily) push that data into Klaviyo as well. Really have to stretch to find disappointing things about this system, though.\n- Wish that the auto responder emails went out faster.
