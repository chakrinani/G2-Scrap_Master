While other systems touted the ability to capture lots of information, it usually results in requiring the user to manually input extraneous data, which for busy people means they are less likely to utilize the program. With Mothernode, the being able to quickly enter the few necessary fields means our sales people are actively using the program, which leads to better tracking and makes it easier to follow up, and close more sales. While a prospect moves through the funnel, then we can add additional data as needed.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Mothernode?\nThe only real dislike is with the lead capture forms. While they absolutely work, their design is a bit old and our responsive website requires two different versions of the same form so that users can see a correctly sized form based upon if they are accessing via a phone or a desktop computer. We have multiple different forms, and in multiple languages, so then number of forms can grow exponentially.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Mothernode:\nWhile not for every company, this ease to set up and use CRM works well and includes a lot of good features.\n\nWhat problems is Mothernode solving and how is that benefiting you?\nWe are increasing accountability with our sales people.

While other systems touted the ability to capture lots of information, it usually results in requiring the user to manually input extraneous data, which for busy people means they are less likely to utilize the program. With Mothernode, the being able to quickly enter the few necessary fields means our sales people are actively using the program, which leads to better tracking and makes it easier to follow up, and close more sales. While a prospect moves through the funnel, then we can add additional data as needed."}, {"question": "What do you dislike about Mothernode?", "answer": "The only real dislike is with the lead capture forms. While they absolutely work, their design is a bit old and our responsive website requires two different versions of the same form so that users can see a correctly sized form based upon if they are accessing via a phone or a desktop computer. We have multiple different forms, and in multiple languages, so then number of forms can grow exponentially."}, {"question": "Recommendations to others considering Mothernode:", "answer": "While not for every company, this ease to set up and use CRM works well and includes a lot of good features."}, {"question": "What problems is Mothernode solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "We are increasing accountability with our sales people.

We use it to run our entire business. Quotes, Orders, Invoices, Purchase Orders, etc. It keeps things simple. Easy to run reports and find what you are looking for. I really like the flexibility I get working in the cloud so I can work remotely if/when I have to. I also like being able to send invoices to customers through the system and see how many times they've opened them. We can do the same thing with quotes and POs.

It would be nice if we could have a customer portal that would allow our customers to access their invoices, etc.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Mothernode:\nDon't shortcut any implementation items. We had a bigger implementation process because we were bringing in data from our previous system. Rather than have our Mothernode account manager work with us to migrate the data, we manually entered everything and since we were new to the process we made many mistakes.\n\nMake sure you fully communicate your business process to them upfront. Draw it out, get everyone involved. They did everything we asked, but some things we left out that needed to be corrected after we started using it. Make sure you get everyone's feedback during evaluation process to make sure they do everything they need to before you go live with the software.\n\nWhat problems is Mothernode solving and how is that benefiting you?\nSince everyone in the company pretty much uses the program it's a huge timesaver when passing information from one department to another.  It's been great for customer service, because you always get notifications about the import activities that take place with our account, so we don't have to make so many inquiries internally with others in the company .
