During this time, we can concentrate more on running the business while extending our marketing efforts without having to send and share this content with our prospective clients repeatedly, as we used to. It is also feasible to alter or update the running campaigns. When we obtain new prospective clients, we just update the current campaigns to accommodate them rather than creating new ones. This saved us a significant amount of time and work.\n\nThe ability to link social media accounts is another helpful feature of MioDatos. For instance, we connected our official Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn pages to the platform and now our news feeds are conveniently populated. This offers us a greater understanding of what our followers are posting. Since the posts are presented with comments, it makes it easier for us to respond to them right away and maintain a conversation with them.\n\nI should also point out how keen I noted the platform is to quickly help users (especially new users get) familiar with it. For instance, they give you an Excel template when uploading a contacts file so you can see the type and format of the file they expect.\n\nWhat do you dislike about MioDatos?\nThe only issue I had with the platform was when I was first setting up the account. The verification code took so long that I had to shift my attention and focus on something else while I waited for it so that I could continue setting up the account. I eventually received it and was able to finish setting up the account. I would advise them to investigate this matter as it may turn off many prospective clients, as such a delay may generate a bad image that the company is untrustworthy. It's worth noting that  I haven't had any additional issues with the platform after the account was fully set.\n\nWhat problems is MioDatos solving and how is that benefiting you?\nBy automating the marketing process, our company is able to increase sales and conversations.\n\nMostly I use the platform to automate email marketing, social media marketing and generating leads. Usually, this is a time-consuming process, but with MioDatos, I'm able to save a lot of time and resources.", "review_question_answers": [{"question": "What do you like best about MioDatos?", "answer": "When developing marketing content for our company, such as product announcements, emails, social media postings, and landing pages, we just put them into campaigns that last four to six months. During this time, we can concentrate more on running the business while extending our marketing efforts without having to send and share this content with our prospective clients repeatedly, as we used to. It is also feasible to alter or update the running campaigns. When we obtain new prospective clients, we just update the current campaigns to accommodate them rather than creating new ones. This saved us a significant amount of time and work.\n\nThe ability to link social media accounts is another helpful feature of MioDatos. For instance, we connected our official Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn pages to the platform and now our news feeds are conveniently populated. This offers us a greater understanding of what our followers are posting. Since the posts are presented with comments, it makes it easier for us to respond to them right away and maintain a conversation with them.\n\nI should also point out how keen I noted the platform is to quickly help users (especially new users get) familiar with it. For instance, they give you an Excel template when uploading a contacts file so you can see the type and format of the file they expect."}, {"question": "What do you dislike about MioDatos?", "answer": "The only issue I had with the platform was when I was first setting up the account. The verification code took so long that I had to shift my attention and focus on something else while I waited for it so that I could continue setting up the account. I eventually received it and was able to finish setting up the account. I would advise them to investigate this matter as it may turn off many prospective clients, as such a delay may generate a bad image that the company is untrustworthy.
