Because our conversations would get pretty complex, the map felt a bit overwhelming when I tried to navigate through it. But once I got used to that it was all very intuitive.\n\nSome of the more complex features like retargeting automation and segmentation had a steeper learning curve, but customer success was very helpful in setting this up with us.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Spectrm:\nDo it! The idea of building a Bot was quite scary, but my concerns were unfounded. The platform was easy to use an intuitive, even for someone with limited 'tech' experience. Customer success couldn't be better. So nice. So helpful. Nicholas from Customer Success bent over backwards to help us do this and everyone we've spoken to Spectrm has been fantastic. That's not always the experience. As a charity, it's always nice to hear that people are excited because it's a good cause, but that doesn't always translate into action, and throughout the process we all felt really supported and inspired. Even since launching if we ever had questions about stuff we've been able to get answers really fast.\n\nWhat problems is Spectrm solving and how is that benefiting you?\nAs a breast cancer education charity, we were setting out to achieve a behaviour change that is usually only possible in person. Influencing behaviour in a digital environment is a real challenge for us, it's difficult to encourage young people to check themselves regularly without the reassurance that can be given in a persion-to-person interaction (you're doing this right, keep it up!). Spectrm helped achieve the scale we wanted with an interactive format that guided our audience in real-time. Our young audience are digital natives so being able. to reach them in their native environement (on social media) was a crucial factor in the bot's success. The response was amazing and we definitely achieved that objective.\n\n\nOur brand lift study on Facebook showed we performed 2-3x higher with Spectrm than the industry average on every major brand lift metric. Ad recall was +24.2 pts, campaign awareness was +7.9 lift and action intent was +4.9 pts.\n\n\nThe automated messaging through the platform was pivotal. Being able to offer a regular reminder through it helped re-engage our audience.\n\n\n22% of people subscribed for a Messenger reminder. Engagement was much higher than we expected. We were driving traffic through ads, so this was a lot of people's first interaction with CoppaFeel!. Because of that we expected the likelihood that someone would subscribe to be much lower since we were unknown to them. That definitely wasn't the case.", "review_question_answers": [{"question": "What do you like best about Spectrm?", "answer": "We were so excited about having the. opportunity to create a Boob Checking Chat Bot, but initially, I was worried building a bot would be hard, without a background in tech!

Customer success couldn't be better. So nice. So helpful. Nicholas from Customer Success bent over backwards to help us do this and everyone we've spoken to Spectrm has been fantastic. That's not always the experience. As a charity, it's always nice to hear that people are excited because it's a good cause, but that doesn't always translate into action, and throughout the process we all felt really supported and inspired. Even since launching if we ever had questions about stuff we've been able to get answers really fast."}, {"question": "What problems is Spectrm solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "As a breast cancer education charity, we were setting out to achieve a behaviour change that is usually only possible in person. Influencing behaviour in a digital environment is a real challenge for us, it's difficult to encourage young people to check themselves regularly without the reassurance that can be given in a persion-to-person interaction (you're doing this right, keep it up!). Spectrm helped achieve the scale we wanted with an interactive format that guided our audience in real-time. Our young audience are digital natives so being able. to reach them in their native environement (on social media) was a crucial factor in the bot's success. The response was amazing and we definitely achieved that objective.\n\n\nOur brand lift study on Facebook showed we performed 2-3x higher with Spectrm than the industry average on every major brand lift metric. Ad recall was +24.2 pts, campaign awareness was +7.9 lift and action intent was +4.9 pts.\n\n\nThe automated messaging through the platform was pivotal. Being able to offer a regular reminder through it helped re-engage our audience.\n\n\n22% of people subscribed for a Messenger reminder. Engagement was much higher than we expected. We were driving traffic through ads, so this was a lot of people's first interaction with CoppaFeel!. Because of that we expected the likelihood that someone would subscribe to be much lower since we were unknown to them. That definitely wasn't the case."}], "review_rating": 5.0, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "Sinead M.", "reviewer_job_title": "Creative & Brand Manager", "reviewer_link": "https://www.g2.com/users/96bbdbcd-84ae-452d-bdbc-1ee4adf3a32c"}, "publish_date": "2020-03-25T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Small-Business(50 or fewer emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/spectrm/reviews/spectrm-review-4157763"}, {"review_id": 4589872, "review_title": "Very easy platform to use and constant support from the team.", "review_content": "What do you like best about Spectrm?\n- how easy it was to understand how to create chatbot structure\n-support from the team\n-easy to upload assets (images, feed etc)\n\nWhat do you dislike about Spectrm?\n-more complicated to measure results (Adobe last click attribution)\n-more complicated to connect/disconnect from page.
