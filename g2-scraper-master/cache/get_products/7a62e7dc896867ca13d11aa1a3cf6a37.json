It's really easy to troubleshoot customer problems by having all activity, event and campaign data per user profiling in one easy to find interface. I also like the newly introduced template creator. As we use the Visual Editor for the majority of our sends, the new update has made it incredibly clear to build, proof in multiple devices and also test recommendations and dynamic content based on how easy it is to select different users/attributes and see them change in live.\n\nAnother benefit is how clear it is to set up and execute campaigns. Having all the campaign, segment and templates in one easy view gives me peace of mind whenever I'm sending campaigns.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Blueshift?\nOne thing Blueshift falls down on is the automation and journey builders. At the moment, it feels very static. With most products, you would expect a clear and easy to use drag and drop journey builder, where it's clear to see how the activity will be prioritised, and what happens if a user is skipped from a certain trigger - what happens next? As we're trying to roll out quite complex behavioural automation campaigns, it's quite difficult to build these. What's more, because it's static, it's difficult to amend the ordering of templates and work on the prioritisation without having to delete templates.\n\nAnother feature which I think needs work is the testing within automated campaigns. It's great to be able to test subject lines OR templates on an activity, but if you want to test the other option, you have to archive the activity (which I believe takes users out of the flow if they're at that stage, but more importantly archives any results attributed to that activity step). It would be great if we could just swap between template and subject testing without having to archive that activity step.\n\nThe only other feature which I think needs work is the dashboard metrics. It would be great if we could build out more compound metrics to display (I think the max is 12?). It would be beneficial to have more of these, but also to be able to change the ordering. At the moment, I think it's ordered by alphabet, whereas I would like to be able to change these to how I perceive campaign performance.\n\nWhat problems is Blueshift solving and how is that benefiting you?\nNot only do we use Blueshift for all of our BAU marketing, it's also really important to us because we use it for our user behaviour analysis, for example using pageload events to see what users are doing on-site and where, as well as the goal events to see where our revenue and product conversions are coming from.\n\nWe've solved countless automation issues with Blueshift, which is great. If we can see a better journey builder in the future, this will only unlock us more.\n\nThe other solution that stands out is advertising through other platforms, Facebook for example. Being able to use the data syndication feature to segment a particular user group based on events in Blueshift, and then being able to create a lookalike from Facebook through snydicating that data through has definitely increase acquisition conversion, whilst bringing down the costs there.", "review_question_answers": [{"question": "What do you like best about Blueshift?", "answer": "User profiling.

We came from a system that look literally days to upload a list larger than 400k contacts, so it was refreshing to move around in Blueshift with little to no load time troubles.\n- Tags...I know this is a weird one, but they have a filtering system where you can tag segments, templates, and campaigns under a tag filter. This makes things super easy to find, and the ability to add the tag is great. I'd suggest tackling this as a framework so you don't end up with 50 tags.\n- Testing...the ease and dynamic-ness of testing in Blueshift is super fun.

We've run into some snags but the team have been really quick to resolve them for us."}, {"question": "What problems is Blueshift solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "We've got a large customer base and an unusual commercial model.   Deliverying personalised comms to this base has been very tricky and we found it difficult to find a partner as most comms software platforms are geared up for straightforward e-commerce businesses, Because Blueshift is more flexible we've been able to solve these issues. Now nearly half of everything we send is personalised to some extent - this in turn has results in a big uplift in revenue from these channels."}], "review_rating": 5.0, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "Rebecca S.", "reviewer_job_title": "Head of Communications", "reviewer_link": "https://www.g2.com/users/0032d1df-6773-45cf-bb48-b4f47d4d601a"}, "publish_date": "2017-01-27T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Mid-Market(51-1000 emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/blueshift/reviews/blueshift-labs-review-233885"}, {"review_id": 250295, "review_title": "Still getting started, but very promising tool", "review_content": "What do you like best about Blueshift?\nThis is a very powerful tool.
