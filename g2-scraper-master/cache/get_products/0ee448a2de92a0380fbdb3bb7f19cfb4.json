The hyper-personalization and real-time reward distribution also let us reward and recognize our employees in a manner that is a win-win situation for both of us. Another thing that I like is their UI, it is simple and elegant and everything is under one screen, so you need not find it difficult to navigate into places.It's been 6 months that we have been using xoxoday as a frequent platform for rewarding and incentivising our Ackers.\n\nAnother thing I like about Xoxoday is that they offer data and analytics tools that help us to track the effectiveness of our incentive programs and make data-driven decisions for improvement.\n\nAnd just in case you face any difficulties, their customer support is round the corner to go above and beyond to help you out. Just drop them an email and it gets resolved under 24 hours."}, {"question": "What do you dislike about Xoxoday?", "answer": "I wish there would have been a chatbot on the tool where we can write our issues and it can get resolved.

And also the claiming of reward should include customizable values as it only provides round figures it's very difficult to select particular values.

It also keeps us updated on birthdays and rewards which is really beneficial as the current work from home we won't have the regular in-person meet with people to know them. And its very useful if you want to gift vouchers and also we have lots of variety to choose from which makes the experience, even more, better for the users. And anyone who is just a beginner can just follow the steps and claim the rewards.

I am really pleased by the wide range of options provided. My overall experience was great and it's very easy if you want to gift someone as it comes with easy claiming on rewards and also the verity of opts which they provide is really good. Just go for it and have the seamless experience that they provide on their platform."}, {"question": "What do you dislike about Xoxoday?", "answer": "There are not many things that I dislike about the platform but it can be made more user-friendly and UI can be worked upon and sometimes the coupons availing and delivery take a longer time which can be reduced a bit. And also the claiming of reward should include customizable values as it only provides round figures it's very difficult to select particular values. Other than that I don't think there is anything as everything else is good."}, {"question": "Recommendations to others considering Xoxoday:", "answer": "I definitely recommend everyone to use this platform as it's so user-friendly and best in terms of keeping yourself updated on what's going on company-wide and also claiming rewards."}, {"question": "What problems is Xoxoday solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "It is a very user-friendly website and has many benefits. It also keeps us updated on birthdays and rewards which is really beneficial as the current work from home we won't have the regular in-person meet with people to know them. And its very useful if you want to gift vouchers and also we have lots of variety to choose from which makes the experience, even more, better for the users. And anyone who is just a beginner can just follow the steps and claim the rewards.
