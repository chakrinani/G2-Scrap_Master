Able to make good-looking and functional emails very easily, or drop in pre-built HTML emails with simple HTML editing that works. Segments were easy to build, good journey tools, easy to use personalisation options and good insights shared with their customers. We used it for every email sent to customers. It was implemented in 2009 - we had a long contract.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Dotdigital?\nWe wanted to expand our contract with Dotdigital by linking our CMS with the platform, making personalisation and segmentation more powerful. I contacted customer support in August 2021 about the plug-in solution. After a delay in which I had to follow up several times, I got through to a Customer Success manager in September.

If you're used to e.g. Autopilot, Sharpspring, Hubspot, Marketing Cloud, Pardot  you quickly (unfortunually not during demo) notice Dotdigital needs to step up there game (for 2 years already).    Yes, the integration within Salesforce is great.  But all other sucks.  You  can't create tasks based on triggers, you can't  create opportunities based on triggers, etc etc.    The add contact / add lead trigger in automations works badly and only allows for syncing standard fields name, businessname, email, phone.    No customs fields are possible.  The whole integration interface is also terrible.    If you really want your marketing automation and CRM to work hand in hand, skip Dotdigital (for now, I hope!)\n\nZapier integration:\nSame story as above, only some basic triggers.    Also only forms can be the trigger.  Not a node within your automation program for example or an action within an e-mail.\n\nFields:\nVery basic stuff. They've been promising for 2 years now to make this better. But it's getting postponed each time.\n\nChat:\nI have  not yet used it personaly, but from the looks it is a to soon released product.  What botters me the most is that Dotdigital isn't even using there own chat program, no they used Intercom and a other chat program.   Honestly, a company that is not using it's own products is very bad\n\nWebinsights:\nCompare this to any other MA tool and you see the tracking options are lacking, all data is hard text, nothing is visual, there is no realtime feed, no pre-recognision etc etc.   It works okay, but not good enough for the price you pay.\n\nForms and pages:\nSome things work great and are thought out, but many things aren't:  The forms have a horrible user experience to built.   Even basic field types are missing, you can only have dependencies/logic flows on 2 or 3 basic fields.   Really, if you are used to Formidable Forms, Gravity Forms, Hubspot etc the experience is heroundus.   The stats/reporting is even worse on the forms.\n\nPages allow tracking which is nice. But you need to manually add this to each and every page. Which sucks!\n\nContactlist:\ncan only be searched on e-mailadress which makes no sense.  If you want to find a specific person it's a needle in the haystack.  Also the contactpages are incomplete lacking for example filled in forms or a a visual view of pages that have been visited on your website.\n\nEmailing: most features are amazing when it comes to email, but the whole dynamic posting is not thought out. You can only do this on very view parameters, needing a lot of hassle for an easy task.\n\nAutomations: In the basic it works. But I would prefer a lot more different type of nodes. A lot better integration with third parties like Wordpress, Salesforce, Zapier etc.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Dotdigital:\nReally make sure what you want to do.

It is great that all the important aspects (Landing Pages, Surveys, Reporting) are included. The Training made it easy to get into it and see what you can actually do with the tool. Also the learning hub and the support library are well structured and filled with tutorials that help with problems and to improve processes.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Dotdigital?\nThe livechat for support is great and you'll get solutions for any kind of problems very fast. However, if the problem is somehow more difficult to solve it takes quite long for the development team until you get an answer. The good thing is, that the support always kept me updated so that I know that no one forgot me.

On the other Hand it is great for beginners and experts can still design their templates in the HTML editor.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Dotdigital:\nUse the Training in order to get the most out of the Tool.

There is also no Spell Check which has proven challenging when sending out short-notice communication pieces.

We wanted the product grid to be styled a specific way and not the generic grid which didn't look very nice and our developers had to do this in a specific file on the backend - not something we could have done ourselves as marketers. Also, the extension with Magento is not an API, so the data you can send back to Dotmailer is limited to what they had set up in the extension. If you want to track what page your subscribers are coming from (footer vs. specific landing page) or send additional data points (language preference/profiling consent), you can't because Dotmailer simply won't pull additional information. Shockingly, there's no easy way to track number of New Subscribers - only New Contacts, which is not the same as Subscribers because all Magento customers flow into Dotmailer, so it's counting all customer emails and not people who actively Subscribed. Not sure why an ESP wouldn't have this as a KPI. We've spoken with Support and our PM and no one has been able to provide a solution, so we have not been able to track Subscriber rate/Churn rate, which is ridiculous. Our designer also found the email builder to have default padding and there's no way to change the default, so it has to be removed every single time, which is annoying. If you click into Contacts, by default, it doesn't land on ALL Address Books for whatever reason, but some subcategory folder, which has no address books, so it's an extra click to ALL to see all address books. Then if you click into any of the books, then click back, it lands you back in the default folder, and not the page you were on previously, so it's just an extra step every time that makes it feel quite convoluted.

The system of folders and images is too nested, could be easier and quicker to navigate. Thumbnails, especially in the templates section, do not update quickly or at all. Truncated titles of jpegs in the image library dont expand or preview, making longer names difficult to tell apart."}, {"question": "What problems is Dotdigital solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "Our data is all in one place now and it is a large improvement over our last ESP, Marketraq."}], "review_rating": 3.0, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "NOT GIVEN", "reviewer_job_title": "NOT GIVEN", "reviewer_link": "NOT GIVEN"}, "publish_date": "2018-11-14T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Small-Business(50 or fewer emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/dotdigital/reviews/dotdigital-review-1171067"}, {"review_id": 1481381, "review_title": "Great email platform with amazing automation capabilities", "review_content": "What do you like best about Dotdigital?\nOptions!

Using through third party TT Mail, but always good customer service.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Dotdigital?\nThat you can no longer export the full details (i.e. donor number) of your own donor, which you uploaded in the first place, once they unsubscribe.  We now cannot put the file back into our database to update GDPR preferences, without manually having to add the donor number back in.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Dotdigital:\nConsider if your database can match on email address, otherwise you won't be able to automatically upload unsubscribe lists to update donor preferences.  Very frustrating since this has been possible for the 10+ years we've used TT Mail, but was withdrawn due to misinterpretation of the new GDPR regs.\n\nWhat problems is Dotdigital solving and how is that benefiting you?\nWe've used DotMailer for years, through charity intermediary TT Mail.  It has been excellent, until a recent 'improvement', justified by some 'interesting'interpretation of the new GDPR regs, means that when we generate an unsubscribed list, the exported file no longer contains our donor number.  Since we input the donor number and other info ourselves and are obviously only doing so with donors who have a clear email opt-in, this seems ridiculous.

We used to have Mad Mimi (which is extremely good for the cost and is a very good basic emailing tool), but DotMailer integration allows customers to update mailing preferences and updates automatically on bounce-backs.\nIt is also extremely helpful that the CRM marketing lists are updated from our 60 users of CRM, which in turn updates DotMailer email lists - I don't have to worry about updating the database.\nThe feature i have benefited from the most is the ability to analyze DotMailer stats in our CRM system which allows us to cross reference data.\nThe DotSurvey and Microsite features are pretty good too, allowing online interaction with our customers.  We were originally using Survey Monkey which is a superior survey tool, but if you just need a basic survey tool, using DotSurvey means you don't have to keep importing up to date contact lists before each survey.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Dotdigital?\nIt's frustrating that integration isn't fully there yet.  We use an on premise in the cloud CRM with ADFS to populate users, and this was a nightmare to then add DotMailer into the mix.  Once past that, we found that our contact data could not sync both ways from the 2 systems - so we have users updating their own address details on forms through DotSurvey which doesn't update CRM.\nAnother area that needs significant work is the microsite capability - it's a really basic editor, which relies on html skills to avoid the page looking 'noddy'.  It also has a few bugs in it working in the browser.\nWe also haven't been able to exploit the feature that shows who has visited the web from email even though we have all the tracking cookies in place on the web.\nThe contract pricing structure is also a little irritating - if you choose to increase your package of monthly sends, your 2 year contract starts again from that new date.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Dotdigital:\nIf you just need an email tool - Mad Mimi is significantly cheaper and free to set up plus their support is very good and there isn't much at all to go wrong. Price bracket is $30/mth for around 10k sends\n\nDotMailer, for the same mailing numbers, sits at around PS270/mth which includes a dedicated CRM license but you get stung for the one of installation cost which is hefty, and we are at the top level package - all this allows full CRM integration.   What that offers is far superior in data analyse and management.\nDotMailer like most software providers sell their package well - but beware, everything they demonstrate during the sales process is not all applicable to every variation of installation.   The ideal platform is their web interface.\nThe support is also reliant on help sheets, videos and online help questions.   And if like us, you are looking at the full integration - they have the bare bones of a support in this area (in the UK)\n\nIf you want more automation and your channels working harder to uncover sales leads, consider looking to invest more but avoid the license driven software options - they are extortionate.\n\n\nWhat problems is Dotdigital solving and how is that benefiting you?\nWe decided to move from Mad Mimi to DotMailer to speed up processes and remove a lot of manual work - importing data back and forth.   It has absolutely served it's purpose and achieved that.\nWhat it has also provided is the ability to re-mail non-openers, set up secondary emails based on actions of the first and my favourite - resend the original email again and again, but only sending to new contacts on the mailing list.\nDotMailer has been in place for 2 years now, and we have realised that we need more integration again between the web and social channels and the ability to run the full campaign from beginning to end with better microsite facilities.
