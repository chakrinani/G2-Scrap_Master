It did not take me long to get our email campaigns sending again during our transition period and I never feel like I am drowning in views or set up screens.  What used to takes 4 screens of options and a few deep platform settings changes is usually done with few clicks.\n\nFiltering the audiences for sends is easy and intuitive. New features and tweaks are added almost monthly but never really disrupt the overall flow of the UI.\n\n*Best Feature -> Their staff is incredibly helpful and responsive to email and help tickets. This is so critical when dealing with marketing deadlines. You won't wait hours and hours for replies.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Cordial?\nWould be nice to have the option to export more of email performance and audience trends as a CSV versus an image.\n\nFiltering audiences based on the non-subscriber data is still in the works. Have had to work around this for some sends.\n\nDynamic content and a/b testing body content requires scripting and may not be easy for end-user types.  and you will have to take a deep dive on the how your product/site/subscriber data is stored before you send more sofiticated emails. (I am sure this is case for most ecommerce related applications)\n\nWould be nice to see a few more options for out of the box intergrations with other marketing software.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Cordial:\nI would take the extra time to build out the product/order data that feeds into Cordial. This will make your life easier down the road and you will have more options when filtering your audiences and creating more personalised messaging.\n\nWhat problems is Cordial solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThe ability to send cart, browse abandonment and triggered/retargeted emails has shifted the whole focus of our email program.

It did not take me long to get our email campaigns sending again during our transition period and I never feel like I am drowning in views or set up screens.  What used to takes 4 screens of options and a few deep platform settings changes is usually done with few clicks.\n\nFiltering the audiences for sends is easy and intuitive. New features and tweaks are added almost monthly but never really disrupt the overall flow of the UI.\n\n*Best Feature -> Their staff is incredibly helpful and responsive to email and help tickets. This is so critical when dealing with marketing deadlines. You won't wait hours and hours for replies."}, {"question": "What do you dislike about Cordial?", "answer": "Would be nice to have the option to export more of email performance and audience trends as a CSV versus an image.\n\nFiltering audiences based on the non-subscriber data is still in the works. Have had to work around this for some sends.\n\nDynamic content and a/b testing body content requires scripting and may not be easy for end-user types.  and you will have to take a deep dive on the how your product/site/subscriber data is stored before you send more sofiticated emails.
