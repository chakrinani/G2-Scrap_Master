Because the platform is broken and unreliable, and I'm constantly spending time trying to fix it, it serves as no benefit for me.\n\nUPDATE 1/19/24: The system is proving to be a big time-saver in automating customer communications. We're able to automate overdraft communications that now save our Operations team 1-2 hours a day in manual customer outreach, Dormant account journeys that save our retail staff time in customer outreach, and onboarding journeys that automate retail communications to new account holders. In addition, it allows our marketing teams to pull customer data that we typically needed our Data teams to pull, saving them a great deal of time as well."}], "review_rating": 3.5, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "Gerald C.", "reviewer_job_title": "NOT GIVEN", "reviewer_link": "https://www.g2.com/users/537b049f-3a77-49e7-8dd4-cf3434413c8e"}, "publish_date": "2024-01-19T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Mid-Market(51-1000 emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/total-expert/reviews/total-expert-review-8402003"}, {"review_id": 9104765, "review_title": "They Are the Expert...
