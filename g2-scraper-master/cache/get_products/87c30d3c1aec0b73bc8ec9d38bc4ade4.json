I wish it was a little cheaper based on the number of subscribers I have, but I think if I worked to grow my email list and effectively use the tool to market my products and generate sales the cost would totally be worth it.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Drip:\nEven if you aren't sure if it's right for you, it's worth checking out. It's not nearly as complicated to setup as some other platforms out there, and there's a lot less to worry about once you're setup and running.
