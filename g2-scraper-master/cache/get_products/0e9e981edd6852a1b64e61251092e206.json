With Jenkins, we automated this process by setting up a pipeline that consists of several stages, including building the application, running tests, and deploying it to the production environment.\nAlso, Jenkins runs a series of automated tests on the application to ensure it functions correctly. These tests include unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests. If any of the tests fail, Jenkins will notify the development team via email or a messaging app, allowing them to address any issues quickly.\nSo with the help of Jenkins, we were able to automate the whole process of deployment."}], "review_rating": 4.0, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "Harshal S.", "reviewer_job_title": "Cloud Engineer", "reviewer_link": "https://www.g2.com/users/495ae48e-2c1c-4783-a2a6-ac00fde81103"}, "publish_date": "2023-03-28T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Mid-Market(51-1000 emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/jenkins/reviews/jenkins-review-7734954"}, {"review_id": 9510428, "review_title": "Jenkins review", "review_content": "What do you like best about Jenkins?\nWe can schedule the executions seemlessly\n\nWhat do you dislike about Jenkins?\nUI is not user friendly and takes large time for initial setup\n\nWhat problems is Jenkins solving and how is that benefiting you?\nHelps in Continuous integration and continuous delivery test automation and task automation", "review_question_answers": [{"question": "What do you like best about Jenkins?", "answer": "We can schedule the executions seemlessly"}, {"question": "What do you dislike about Jenkins?", "answer": "UI is not user friendly and takes large time for initial setup"}, {"question": "What problems is Jenkins solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "Helps in Continuous integration and continuous delivery test automation and task automation"}], "review_rating": 5.0, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "NOT GIVEN", "reviewer_job_title": "NOT GIVEN", "reviewer_link": "NOT GIVEN"}, "publish_date": "2024-04-05T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Mid-Market(51-1000 emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/jenkins/reviews/jenkins-review-9510428"}, {"review_id": 9020946, "review_title": "Best Orchestration tool for DevOps Teams", "review_content": "What do you like best about Jenkins?\nSimple, elegant and lots of documentation available\n\nWhat do you dislike about Jenkins?\nHandling large teams and users management gets difficult over time\n\nWhat problems is Jenkins solving and how is that benefiting you?\nStreamlining CICD and DevOps processes is never been easy as with Jenkins.

It helps in reducing the effort of the developers by deploying the application through a scheduled pipeline. The learning curve is very smooth and very few parameters are required to automate the deployment. Test cases can also be integrated with the pipeline which prevents the breaking of any existing functionality. The code coverage was also part of the pipeline, which brought everything under one roof. Once the pipeline is set up, it can be used multiple times to deeply various branches of the code. While testing any particular feature, any local branch can be deployed very well and tested whether that functionality is working fine without any glitches and hiccups. The interface is quite user friendly and quite intuitive and easy to use.  The amount of customisation provided on the interface is just right and appropiate.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Jenkins?\nAt crucial times of production deployment, some unknown issues crop up, which are very irritating and blocks the deployment. These unknown issues are intermittent and tough to debug.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Jenkins:\nIf you want to free developers from deployment activities, this tool is a wonderful tool to automate deployments and save much of their time.\n\nWhat problems is Jenkins solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThis software makes the deployment much easier by making continuous deployment and continuous integration available through pipelines.

It helps in reducing the effort of the developers by deploying the application through a scheduled pipeline. The learning curve is very smooth and very few parameters are required to automate the deployment. Test cases can also be integrated with the pipeline which prevents the breaking of any existing functionality. The code coverage was also part of the pipeline, which brought everything under one roof. Once the pipeline is set up, it can be used multiple times to deeply various branches of the code. While testing any particular feature, any local branch can be deployed very well and tested whether that functionality is working fine without any glitches and hiccups. The interface is quite user friendly and quite intuitive and easy to use.  The amount of customisation provided on the interface is just right and appropiate."}, {"question": "What do you dislike about Jenkins?", "answer": "At crucial times of production deployment, some unknown issues crop up, which are very irritating and blocks the deployment.

Jenkins can integrate with almost any external system used for developing applications which means that you worry less about your tooling and more about delivering good code.  More recent tools that are cloud-based like CircleCI, TravisCI and CodeShip provide similar features but do not have the comprehensive plugin integration that Jenkins still has.  Anyone using Jenkins also benefits from years of other developers using the product and solving problems meaning that it is rare that you will run into an issue with this tool that hasn't already been solved.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Jenkins?\nJenkins is still heavily plug-in based to add functionality to the base system.  Upgrading and maintaining plugins to get desired functionality can sometimes be frustrating and time consuming.  Upgrading some plugins can sometimes break the functionality of other plugins leading to breaking jobs that were previously working. This is less prevalent than it used to be but anyone managing a Jenkins instance must be cautious about upgrading plugins and breaking user jobs.  That being said, you will not find a greater breadth of plugin variety in any other tool on the market.  Jenkins can connect to almost anything which makes integrating with your system of choice a much easier task.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Jenkins:\nIf you require an on-premise (inside the firewall) CI system then Jenkins will be easy to setup and start using in a very short period of time.  You can always find help online solving any Jenkins issues you come across so you feel supported and that you won't have to spend time troubleshooting your CI install.  If you are open to using cloud tools and you have a simple build then it is worth considering other options because Jenkins is not offered as a cloud service.\n\nWhat problems is Jenkins solving and how is that benefiting you?\nI use Jenkins to provide continuous integration of application code and often use it for continuous deployment as well.  Jenkins can watch source code repositories for changes and immediately pull that code and send it through a battery of steps designed to ensure that no problems were introduced into the code when it is integrated with other developer's code.
