System can get slow and strange bugs are encountered throughout the system (you get 500 server error but no explanation what's wrong). Personalization GUI is super inconvenient and support reps offer to use hacks instead of the standard functionality. Some features are very limited and integrated through third-party integrations - e. g. in order to use web push you need to setup Firebase account first, also no possibility to use it via XML imports or APIs, so pretty much useless feature for companies which use integrations with CRM. Same with post functionality. No Whatsapp, Viber intergrations out-of-the-box. Some features are clearly forgotten (Landing pages, Vouchers)."}, {"question": "What problems is Mapp Marketing Cloud solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "mapp is great for sending e-mails and we are using it as the primary tool to send both batch marketing and transactional e-mails."}], "review_rating": 3.0, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "NOT GIVEN", "reviewer_job_title": "NOT GIVEN", "reviewer_link": "NOT GIVEN"}, "publish_date": "2022-01-20T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Mid-Market(51-1000 emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/mapp-marketing-cloud/reviews/mapp-marketing-cloud-review-5284926"}, {"review_id": 6672907, "review_title": "very friendly and competent people", "review_content": "What do you like best about Mapp Marketing Cloud?\nI can do a lot of things in self service\n\nWhat do you dislike about Mapp Marketing Cloud?\nsometimes I have to wait for the doings i cannot do in self service\n\nWhat problems is Mapp Marketing Cloud solving and how is that benefiting you?\nthey solve bugs in the mailing sending system immediately, they are helping us to serve thousands of customers with information", "review_question_answers": [{"question": "What do you like best about Mapp Marketing Cloud?", "answer": "I can do a lot of things in self service"}, {"question": "What do you dislike about Mapp Marketing Cloud?", "answer": "sometimes I have to wait for the doings i cannot do in self service"}, {"question": "What problems is Mapp Marketing Cloud solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "they solve bugs in the mailing sending system immediately, they are helping us to serve thousands of customers with information"}], "review_rating": 4.5, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "Susanne H.", "reviewer_job_title": "Communication Manager", "reviewer_link": "https://www.g2.com/users/30abca11-3399-4e7f-b3a0-9ed07a78a285"}, "publish_date": "2022-05-27T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Enterprise(> 1000 emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/mapp-marketing-cloud/reviews/mapp-marketing-cloud-review-6672907"}, {"review_id": 5132077, "review_title": "Mapp Cloud is explicitly designed to help consumer-facing brands run highly personalized", "review_content": "What do you like best about Mapp Marketing Cloud?\nI've been trying to find an easy way to map out my business strategies for years, and I always found myself pulling my hair out with all the programs.
