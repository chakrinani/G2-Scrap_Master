This makes it possible to maintain discussion groups without having to constantly manually update their membership, which could take hours and hours every day, if you're an association of any size.\n\nThe discussion group system also lets you bring in members who are still wedded to listservs, as it incorporates the ability to send and receive posts to the discussion groups via email.

If you do some digging in their customer support forums, you'll find that people have been requesting this feature for at least six years.\n\nCustomer service and maintenance of what I see as their core product (the discussion group system) has dropped off even further in the last two years. The company has acquired four other companies in that time (RealMagnet, Informz, Socious, and Kavi) and it seems deadset on creating a monopoly on communication services for associations. The results, so far, have been as chaotic as you'd think. Customer service has become slow, uneven, and about as transparent as mud (often you'll be told by customer service to post your issue in the client discussion group and if you post in the client discussion group, you'll be told to contact customer service). No one seems to know what features are being prioritized for development or what the timelines might be. Often you're told to use clunky workarounds that you then have to somehow educate your poor members about and do a song-and-dance for them to convince them that the workarounds are convenient and/or will be fixed soon.

Real Magnet is not a perfect fit for everything we want to do with it, but it is a no-brainer for me to recommend sticking with it. Their development team regularly releases enhancements and improvements. Feature requests we submit have already been deployed. Other features further down in their backlog, we know can be custom developed for us by Real Magnet for a reasonable additional fee -- and I do mean reasonable. At no point have I felt \"nickel and dimed\" by Real Magnet nor taken advantage of. We have an in-house development team that could customize things more for us via the Real Magnet API, but the team at Real Magnet is so gosh darn responsive that I often find it easier/faster to let Real Magnet handle it.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Higher Logic Thrive?\nThere are some quirks to using the template editor that confuse our technology-challenged users. The UX and naming conventions within Real Magnet can add to that. Usually the things about Real Magnet that we don't like or that cause confusion can be fixed with extra training of our end users. The bulk of our \"wants\" list is cosmetic, not functionality related.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Higher Logic Thrive:\nTo be most effective, I would recommend committing an FTE purely to email management if possible. The majority of our communications with members are in their inboxes. Having at least one person that all staff can go to for assistance and who has a holistic view of all email activity across the organization has been crucial.\n\nWhat problems is Higher Logic Thrive solving and how is that benefiting you?\nWe are overhauling our entire digital communications portfolio in a proper transformation project that has spanned the past 2 years. We chose Real Magnet after reviewing several alternatives and initiating a pilot of Real Magnet for a small group of internal content creators. Our major goals were to streamline content creation, increase digital engagement, and ultimately to provide a personalized experience for members across all our platforms (web, email, direct mail, social).\n\nReal Magnet's permissions settings allow our communications admin team to fine tune each staff person's experience and access. This eases the burden of having to police each user account, which has been a major pain point internally. Other benefits range from embarrassingly basic (embarrassing in that we didn't have that functionality before) to beyond our expectations.\n\nWe are finally able to compile reports on email activity across all internal departments. We can now track and better govern what emails get to our members's inboxes. We have been able to nurture an organizational mindset shift towards targeting communications more, using data to make decisions, and think of emails not as individual messages but as just one part of larger digital campaigns. This mindset shift has been the most difficult, but ultimately is the most rewarding because it also represents a culture change within the staff.\n\nReal Magnet may not be wholly responsible for this culture change, but it has certainly helped expedite it. Our internal staff feel empowered to take control of their content and now have access to the analytics (and training) to help them maximize their email communications. As a colleague put it, \"Real Magnet makes me feel like a data geek.

It feels like these areas were set up by different teams to accomplish different goals -- rather than to help me accomplish my goals. I want a back-end interface that doesn't get in the way of getting my business done. To that end, if everything felt a bit more like the Admin interface, we'd be rocking.\n\nDocumentation can be tricky to find.

Anytime you'd like to edit an image, it will be saved as a copy. And most of the time, image editing takes us a couple tries or two to get it exactly right so we end up having multiple images in the image library. I should say though that you can organize and delete images through their Message Tools but that requires additional clicks and there is the risk of deleting an image that is being used in a live email (which will prevent the image from appearing in those emails)."}, {"question": "What problems is Higher Logic Thrive solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "As a full-service communications and marketing agency, we are constantly looking for new business and opportunities to expand our client base. As such, we need to engage with prospective customer (and existing customers) on a resgular basis.  But how do we do that? The answer was developing an email nurture program and adding an email signup button on our website. Visitors are encouraged to sign up to receive regular updates about industry trends/news, agency announcements, upcoming events, etc.\n\nThere are a number of benefits to this--continual engagement with our target audiences, integration with our social media marketing efforts, lead scoring capabilities, and providing personalized emails using dynamic content. And like any agency, we are constantly improving and evolving.
