Over the past year, backend performance has declined, leading to slower page load times for end-users, which are now noticeably less efficient. The platform offers an abundance of features, but many seem superfluous, catering only to a limited range of business types and lacking in maturity. Additionally, the user interface (UI) transition is incomplete, falling short of what one might expect from a near-final release, and it appears to have undergone insufficient user testing.\n\nCrucially, several features fundamental to the platform's core functionality are not yet fully operational. For instance, the email designer (builder) is missing modern capabilities that have been standard on comparable platforms for some time. Similarly, the landing page functionality does not meet current standards as it lacks essential features required for effectiveness. The documentation is another area of concern, with a significant portion appearing outdated. Keap should refocus on it core strengths and refine these features to a high degree and then branch out to other features in my opinion.\n\nThe mobile app has posed persistent issues for users over many years. Furthermore, Keap's attempt to integrate AI assistance in content creation is currently subpar and falls short of being practically useful at the time of this review. This feature, in its present state, should be considered for removal from the app in favor of implementing a third-party solution, as seen with other platforms.\n\nWhat problems is Keap solving and how is that benefiting you?\nWe use Keap to automate some of our marketing efforts, but not all. We do not market via SMS but use it for client reminders. We keep most client data in Keap and use this for client retention marketing.

Though our experience with Keap went beyond an accidental mistake and after debating for a long time, I feel sharing my experience is absolutely necessary.\n\nLong story short:\n\n- We first spoke with a guy named Colin who was in charge of closing the sale. He seemed a very nice and friendly guy, though sometimes he sounded slightly generic about what our migration from our current autoresponder to Keap would entail.\n\n- He was so nice we even bought an extra $500 of Keap coaching calls (shame on us for not waiting).\n\n- He reassured us that our packed came with 15 hours of migration included and that everything we had on our current autoresponder, would be easily migrated within those 15 hours. Just to be sure, I repeatedly asked him confirmation (both on the call and in written form) that all our sequences, automations, contacts, templates etc could be migrated within those 15 hours. I am NOT a specialist person so clearly I trusted what he said. We submitted everything that we needed to migrate and were confident we were all on the same page.\n\n- A few weeks later, out of the blue, Keap asked us to pay more money, as the 15 hours were done and over with.\n\n- At this point we still had quite a few assets to migrate. They claimed they had already went beyond the 15 hours and while some extra hours had been ''gifted'' now we had to pay extra or take care of the migration internally (which clearly we were not equipped to handle considering it wasn't part pf the plan).\n\n- Even though I was already quite annoyed (considering the guy confirmed already multiple times that in 15 hours they could do everything) I reluctantly asked how much would that extra be. The answer was mind boggling: don't even wanna share the final priced we would have to pay as it was just ridiculous (thousands and thousands of dollars).\n\n- At this point Colin had started to ignore our emails. I called him several times and was told that our team was trying to take advantage of Keap migration team. Wait what?!? I kept my cool and asked to please meet in the middle (even tho this whole situation was entirely created by them) and he seemed confident we'd find a solution. After a few days of back and forth, and the Keap renewal approaching, we had no choice but to stop everything and close our account.\n\n- We requested a partial refund (since they had done some work anyway and I wanted to acknowledge that) so I was referred to this lady called Lisa, who was supposed to ''help'' with this. After speaking to her, instead of being issued a refund, we were charged PS200 termination fee -- like seriously?!?\n\n- After complaining about that (since it was not written anywhere btw), we got refunded these PS200 and that was the end of it.\n\n- So we spent (wasted) 1200 - then got charged an extra PS200 early termination fee and then refunded just that fee.\n\n- At this point I was so annoyed but I was also determined to move on as quickly as possible. So I simply requested at least refund of the $500 ''Keap coaching calls'' that we never even started  (we were supposed to use them after migration was over).\n\n- Our request was ignored and never addressed.\n\nAgain, I don't leave this review light hearted, but this experience was really BAD. We wasted money and precious time (including the 30 mins spent to write this review).\n\nPls be very careful before you sign up with Keap, especially if the assets you got to migrate are quite articulated. Don't just talk to the the sales person, whoever they are, and request to speak to the tech team and have a further confirmation on the migration costs (the REAL ones).

For instance, with the invoicing - it is irritating that invoices can't be customized to 1) look different than the generic layout provided and 2) writing the line items for the invoice is frustrating. As a designer for both graphic and web design, I like to write out descriptions of my hours, and there isn't a memo section on the item lines.

Also, requires a year contract to join, and you must pay for training sessions initially, unless you talk personally with customer service.\n\nWhat problems is Keap solving and how is that benefiting you?\nNone anymore.

There is so much to like about it as it has many features being an all-in-one CRM & Marketing Automation tool.  We specifically use the CRM, email broadcast tool, campaign builder, sales pipeline, eCommerce, subscriptions, affiliates, appointments, and reporting.  My favourite feature is the Campaign Builder.  Being a visual person, I love the ability to map out and build automation that saves hours every week.  It's probably saved me from having to employee a full-time resource as we don't have to do things manually.  The system helps convert additional sales through the automated follow-up and reminders we have setup.  Being a long-term user, it's exciting to see Keap back to the good old days and re-investing back into developing small (but meaningful) and bigger feature releases.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Keap?\nAs with any software, there is always room for improvement.  Being an Australian user, I'm specifically looking forward to some of the new features being rolled out in the future that have successfully launched in the US.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Keap:\nThere can be a learning curve, particularly if you are new to the world of marketing automation.  I think with any software, you need to get clear about what you're trying to achieve and then looking at how the tool can help you get there.  Sometimes with all the bells and whistles you can easily get distracted by features that won't impact your bottom line.  I know I have over the years, so don't let that be you! ;-)\n\nWhat problems is Keap solving and how is that benefiting you?\nKeap solves many problems for our business, but the main ones are, being able to communicate at mass with our database, being able to segment and create targeted messages, following up with leads, selling and taking payments online 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, recording and tracking sales activities, setting reminders to follow up with leads, automating invoices and customer onboarding for new purchases and so much more.

It's probably saved me from having to employee a full-time resource as we don't have to do things manually.  The system helps convert additional sales through the automated follow-up and reminders we have setup.  Being a long-term user, it's exciting to see Keap back to the good old days and re-investing back into developing small (but meaningful) and bigger feature releases."}, {"question": "What do you dislike about Keap?", "answer": "As with any software, there is always room for improvement.  Being an Australian user, I'm specifically looking forward to some of the new features being rolled out in the future that have successfully launched in the US."}, {"question": "Recommendations to others considering Keap:", "answer": "There can be a learning curve, particularly if you are new to the world of marketing automation.  I think with any software, you need to get clear about what you're trying to achieve and then looking at how the tool can help you get there.  Sometimes with all the bells and whistles you can easily get distracted by features that won't impact your bottom line.  I know I have over the years, so don't let that be you! ;-)"}, {"question": "What problems is Keap solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "Keap solves many problems for our business, but the main ones are, being able to communicate at mass with our database, being able to segment and create targeted messages, following up with leads, selling and taking payments online 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, recording and tracking sales activities, setting reminders to follow up with leads, automating invoices and customer onboarding for new purchases and so much more.  It's helped generate thousands in extra revenue, save having to employee a staff member and also reduced the number of hours I spend working at night and on weekends with boring admin work."}], "review_rating": 5.0, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "Mandy B.", "reviewer_job_title": "Director", "reviewer_link": "https://www.g2.com/users/8cba027e-7b1e-4e71-a413-6b8a34180e4e"}, "publish_date": "2021-09-16T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Small-Business(50 or fewer emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/keap-keap/reviews/keap-review-5005183"}, {"review_id": 5301844, "review_title": "Keap make business easier", "review_content": "What do you like best about Keap?\nI really like the system's numerous templates for emails, and the automation tools required less of a learning curve than with other marketing platforms.

Keap makes it so easy to quickly do everything I need to do. There are limitless possibilties with their automation system. When a potential client emails me via my website form, an email is automatically sent back to them that allows them to book an appointment with me then a second is sent (after booking said appointment) with information they need to know before going into said appointment.

I use Square and have for a long time, but Square doesn't have an integration for Keap. Instead, I had to open a new account with another company. Not a bad thing, but not the easiest."}, {"question": "Recommendations to others considering Keap:", "answer": "Look for a company that not only satisfies your organizational needs, but also one that is present when you need them. I cannot tell you how important it is to have a company that answers your calls, responds to your emails, etc. Keap is a company that *listens!* They care about you, not just your money. Sincerity is a precious ethic."}, {"question": "What problems is Keap solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "Time! I am solving the problem of time! No longer do I need to retype email broadcasts every time I want to send a new one. No longer do I need to manually set up appointments for new contacts. All of this is done for me! Keap makes it so easy to quickly do everything I need to do. There are limitless possibilties with their automation system. When a potential client emails me via my website form, an email is automatically sent back to them that allows them to book an appointment with me then a second is sent (after booking said appointment) with information they need to know before going into said appointment. All of this happens without me ever needing to take the time to manually respond. It's such a life saver."}], "review_rating": 5.0, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "Sarah D.", "reviewer_job_title": "Owner", "reviewer_link": "https://www.g2.com/users/1e64cbe6-b017-4166-91ea-22ccc909c098"}, "publish_date": "2021-04-22T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Small-Business(50 or fewer emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/keap-keap/reviews/keap-review-4698814"}, {"review_id": 5286079, "review_title": "Keep has benefited me in so many ways.

Once we grew our list above 500,000 things started to get wonky and above 1 million it was unacceptable.  There are underlying intermittent code issues that are hit more often when you stress the system with more data and more traffic.

The built-in delete process uses up api calls and our member websites also rely heavily on api calls.  Even more problematic was the fact that the campaigns became less and less reliable as the intermittent issues with goals not firing became more frequent. And then there's the InfusionSoft email gestapo. InfusionSoft is NOT on your side when it comes to email deliverability. You can have an absolutely stellar overall spam rate-which is the only thing InfusionSoft data will show you-and still get an automated nastygram threatening to shut down your email sending if you don't fill out a form.

In today's world, instant contact is very important with Campaign Manager, we are able to set up so many different streams to make sure the client is getting the most accurate information that is related to them. With the implementation of tags, possibilities are endless. The drag and drop makes not only being able to visualize the contact stream effectively, but it is amazing when you are able to show bosses, or clients a visual of what the marketing process will look like. They then understand exactly what you are doing and how you plan to implement that process.\n\nThe new business line has made a big difference in my communication as well, it is always nice when you are able to separate your personal life from your business and know when a client is calling vs something personal.\n\nWe also find that the API functionality is quite strong. If there is something that we need to accomplish and can't seem to do that within the program, there always seems to be a way to make it work with the API.\n\nKeap has been very strong at getting back to me with questions or concerns, and have always gone the extra mile when I need something from them.

It is a staple in my toolbox, that I will always have because with it, I keep breaking sales records.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Keap?\nI find that the contact search in Keap is a little buggy, it seems like I have been losing contact information for people I deal with a lot. Nothing has been too extreme, but it is a little annoying. Also, implementation of emails, a lot of companies are just using basic IMAP servers, there is no real way to implement communications with these kinds of emails. With the new messaging inside Keap, it would be very nice if we were able to send I text through the Campaign, instead of having to use a third party like success engine. Then if people respond, it's all in Keap, and we wouldn't have to go to another app.\n\nThe email builder is quite effective, but it would be nice to have a little more control over the design, for example in MailChimp you are able to insert a background image and put elements over that image, like a title or buttons, you are able to to create more of responsive design this way. Currently, we photoshop the image to have a button, which is fine, but not amazing when shrunk down on a phone. It would also be nice to have control over things like border-radius, and padding of elements.\n\nFinally, I wish you were able to customize the Keap dashboard like you can in InfusionsSoft. It would be better to have the information you need at your fingertips when it is needed.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Keap:\nMake the move, don't wait.

And then when they released the phone portion of Keap, it literally is the BEST way to put everything into one place.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Keap?\nI'm a freelancer, and with the pandemic and business slowing down, the price of $100 was too much for me each month. Unfortunately, I had to find something cheaper. I wish that Keap was just even $25 cheaper. I would have been able to Keap (pun intended) it then, however, the price was pretty non-negotiable. I also didn't like the fact that they have a huge signup fee, which they say is used to pay the coach that you get when you sign on. These coaching sessions were a little long and honestly could have been done via youtube videos. Then I wouldn't have to pay the sign-on fee, but I understand these people have to make money too.

The interface is just simple and easy to use. It's easy to adjust Infusionsoft to our individual needs in business - the customization for emails and analytics is just breathtaking compared to other solutions I've experimented with. I was able to create a lot of action calls in Infusionsoft thanks to the lead database management. I also learned a lot about process flows and how it's related to making your business go forward.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Keap?\nThe Infusionsoft platform does not store documents by itself. It does not have live chat tools, and it does not allow to scan business cards, or identification cards for staff. Nor is it integrated into social networking platforms. In terms of databases, Infusionsoft does not work well with them, it is about databases of properties. Neither does it allow to manage SEO.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Keap:\nInfusionsoft is a software focused on offering a very pleasant user experience. It is excellent for search marketing and email. In addition, your inventory manager is very broad. Its use is highly recommended to perform customer service analysis, and to manage web forms. It also works pretty well to create emails that are triggered by events.\n\nWhat problems is Keap solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThe nurturing processes of potential clients are very easy to customize for us in Infusionsoft.

Often times brand fonts cannot be changed - leaving you with a standard New Times Roman font that feels very 90's. The ability to design is very limited and clunky - even with their new drag and drop email builder. From using plenty of email marketing platforms in the past this is very disappointing - be aware that this is certainly a CRM with a shoddy email marketing system plugged in. You can however build emails using HTML code which allows for much more design freedom although it's simply not practical - it leaves you training a team on not just how to use an overly complicated CRM and email marketing platform but also giving a crash course on HTML and CSS code in order to edit communications and templates.\n\nSecondly, the email marketing automation is actually not that bad - flowchart style and easy enough to edit once you've spent a couple of weeks using it, talking with support and watching training videos. However, it is still limited in functionality and purely based on contact tags - this means that building a simple marketing campaign - 'if contact engages X email, send similar email. If not, then send alternate email' - it becomes an absolute nightmare.\n\nPlugins and integrations are aplenty - which is great - but also unnecessary. You should bear in mind that although infusionsoft may be a cheaper price than other all-in-one CRM's you are going to need plenty of additional paid add-ons and plugins/integrations if you are going to get it anyway near performing well. An all-in-one CRM should be exactly that - All -in-one! Jack of all trades, master of none for the most part.\nThere's also a lack of integration which alternative CRM's do offer - such as GoToWebinar, Zoom Webinars etc. which means that you'll have to export your webinar attendees, upload them into infusionsoft with an 'event attended' tag and then check for duplicates and merge found duplicates in order to add any new contacts from webinars/events/downloads etc. It takes a long time, it's frustrating and is completely needless. Most CRM's merge duplicate contacts automatically, but not here.\n\nFinally, reporting is a pain to get right. There's a lot of information but it's scattered around across hundred of different tabs and areas of the platform that you'll often find yourself struggling to find the same report you found the week before - even after over a year of using the platform! It's confusing for an individual and especially for a small team.\n\nTo summarise, Infusionsoft has everything right on paper but when you delve into the platform everything that sounds great in the first instance is actually limited by something completely unnecessary.

It's not the worst platform in the world, but I'd suggest not falling for the snake oil reviews and fluff they present across their website.

I've been super impressed with how much control I actually have over how I set up my campaigns and integrations. The possibilities are truly endless for my business now.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Keap?\nThere is a STEEP learning curve to Infusionsoft, and it's very easy for beginners to break certain processes when they don't know the whole system. I personally do NOT like how integrated contacts and affiliates are. Currently, if you delete a contact, all sales information is also deleted, including commission data for affiliates who referred the sales. This makes it impossible to trim dead weight off of a list if they've made a purchase in the past without affecting affiliate ledgers.\n\nI would also like to see improvement with deliverability and ease of GDPR compliance. ConvertKit tends to land my emails in my subscribers' inboxes more often, and their GDPR compliance process was almost completely hands off, which was SO great. It's very difficult to identify EU subscribers on my list without paying a ton more money for add-on services.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Keap:\nThis is a great option for anyone who really wants to explore building a consulting/service-based business OR for anyone who owns a membership site and/or owns a thriving blog/digital marketing business.

I personally do NOT like how integrated contacts and affiliates are. Currently, if you delete a contact, all sales information is also deleted, including commission data for affiliates who referred the sales. This makes it impossible to trim dead weight off of a list if they've made a purchase in the past without affecting affiliate ledgers.\n\nI would also like to see improvement with deliverability and ease of GDPR compliance. ConvertKit tends to land my emails in my subscribers' inboxes more often, and their GDPR compliance process was almost completely hands off, which was SO great. It's very difficult to identify EU subscribers on my list without paying a ton more money for add-on services."}, {"question": "Recommendations to others considering Keap:", "answer": "This is a great option for anyone who really wants to explore building a consulting/service-based business OR for anyone who owns a membership site and/or owns a thriving blog/digital marketing business.

It provides the ability to literally DESIGN what the process should be from the moment you acquire a contact (prospect, lead, sale... any level), through to delivery and satisfaction of the customer.  Virtual hand-offs from one campaign to another are both possible and required to make the entire business-process-automation maintainable.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Keap?\nOf late (12/17 - 2/1), spam-bots are winning.  A bot will fill out a lead form, using a legitimate email and a bogus name, creating a bogus contact record.  You send a message (even a double-opt-in confirmation), but it's to a legitimate human who was subscribed by a bot.  The human will flag you as a spammer.  There are steps you can take to stop this, but they require additional, non-standard efforts to implement.\n\nThe tool is not hard to use but does require considerable practice and experience to use it well.  Imagine a large Lego set to build a spaceship.  With instructions, a 10-year-old can build it.  But if all you have are the parts (design elements), then it is unlikely that the spaceship is going to turn out well.  But once it's built, even a 5-year old can play with it.  So you really do need help with initial implementation and design with Infusionsoft in order for your own business to fly through the universe.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Keap:\nDon't make the mistake of thinking you can do it all yourself.  The reason Infusionsoft requires a partner to help with setup (Their kick-starter packages) is that they are more interested in your success than in having you purchase the product and fail.  Used well, that kick-start is the best investment you can make with implementation.  It's not like an automotive service-package that you may or may not use.  Rather, it's more like putting gas, oil, and fluids into the car before you leave the lot.\n\nWhat problems is Keap solving and how is that benefiting you?\nAfter designing a campaign that tracked students through a 3-year program with yearly renewal, we found that our billing process had a hole, and many students never paid the next year's tuition.

How do we move faster when I am not provided with relevant recommendations?\n\nWhen I complained and asked for refund of my Kick Starter money, my account manager didn't care and had very little to offer for compensation and asked me to pay extra $200/h for extra help\n\ninfusionsoft has surprising limitation in the eCommerce section, apparently you can't do simple stuff like adding a link to accept terms & condition on order cart without spending $1000 to ask a developer to give you a custom code in addition to so many things that seams very basic with any other eCommerce platform ... I am currently using WooCommerce and I find it 100 times better than infusionsoft eCommerce\n\nFinally ....

They told us we could do this out-of-the box, but after paying their onboarding fees they told us that this requires extra custom coding work. So, we are currently seeking a refund. Their sales team was shady and pushy the whole way and we were very disappointed to find out they lied about a key feature. Plus, as an experienced digital marketer who has used a variety of software products I was generally unimpressed with Infusionsoft once I dove into it.\n\nI would still recommend IS to a small business owner who has little time on their hands/small budget and wants a powerful automation tool.

Infusionsoft quickly proved to be a small business platform that can truly automate your business. Whether you need to get up and running fast or your business is complex and needs to be highly configured, Infusionsoft is still your best bet. It's so easy to setup everything from workflows, opportunities, email templates and even campaigns. The marketing automation and campaign creation was very new to me and I quickly found out how easy it is to setup goals and the workflow needed within Infusionsoft.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Keap?\nMy only dislike is that when you search for something, you have to specify whether its a contact or company.

If you have a membership product, stay FAR FAR away. In fact, run as fast as you can AWAY from InfusionsIoft.\n\nIn order to cancel a subscription, there are 3 steps. There online documentation only lists 2 of the 3 steps and their support staff is highly incompetent (more on that later). So if you miss a step because you trusted their step-by-step instructions, you'd either get chargebacks or miss out on subscription payments that were supposed to be rebilled or cancelled but were not. In my case, this cost me at least $3000 in lost sales not to mention the chargebacks that occured because of system issues.\n\nToday (Sept 29, 2014) I found one subscription that was still active, never canceled and had all the right settings from FEBRUARY 2014, which was supposed to be billed monthly. However, this customer was never rebilled due to some mysterious Infusionsoft bug. I looked at the order history and guess what? The Infusionsoft system decided to bill the customer on 9/23/14 - 6 MONTHS AFTER the last rebill was supposed to happen. Luckily the customer's card was declined. But just imagine the nightmare that would have been if the payment was successful... refund/chargeback, bad reviews, complaints... And I have hundreds of customers. Am I to review every single file in Infusionsoft's clunky interface to find these bugs? This is just flat out wrong.\n\nNow let's get to their highly incompetent tech support staff. When I see an issue like this, my first instinct is to obviously FIX THE SETTINGS (i.e. cancel the subscription so that the customer doesn't get rebilled AGAIN when Infusionsoft feels like it). But --- if you are going to send this to their support, you CANNOT change a single thing. You'd have to leave everything as is or else they cannot help you because they have no way to check on or replicate the issue. Then, you just have to wait and hope and pray that they will get back to you with a solution before the next rebill date (30 days away) - which would be a miracle.\n\nI've sent them many support tickets and I learned that you have to document everything single thing with screen shots and videos or they do not believe that you even had the issue to begin with. And on top of that, they have never come back to me with a valid solution. I've either gotten \"It's taking longer than usual to resolve this...\" and never hear back from them again OR \"This is a known bug...\"  Now, how are you supposed to run your business knowing that the system is just going to randomly fail for no valid reason at all AND nothing is going to be done to fix it??\n\nTheir campaign functionality cannot be trusted either. If subsequent actions happen \"too fast\" (too fast means within 30 MINUTES), then you run the risk of steps in your sequences being skipped and just flat out not running at all. And keep in mind, this happens randomly so you will have no control and you'd have to check everyday for weird bugs that Infusionsoft will never help you fix because the cases are \"one off\". Last week I emailed Infusionsoft regarding this exact case - no response yet. I've seen this happening in several other campaigns (campaign sequences getting skipped because the previous action happened too quickly), but I've been resigned to just live with all of these \"one off\" programming exceptions.\n\nOh and \"PayPal integration?\" Forget about it. If you need to refund a PayPal client, you'll have to do it twice. Once in Infusionsoft and once in PayPal. What about PayPal eChecks that take a few days to clear? Infusionsoft still counts them as VALID sales on the date of the transaction. Good thing PayPal sends email notifications of these things - because if you trusted your Infusionsoft transaction reports, you'd think the sales are paid for when in reality, they're not.\n\nReporting and analytics?? Despite all of the headaches and nightmares I have experienced with failing campaigns, I have to say that reporting is THE WORST feature of Infusionsoft. Example: You have a subscription product and you set the system to attempt to autocharge 4 times, once a day. Each time it fails, Infusionsoft still counts that as part of your gross revenue, even though it is ONE payment from ONE customer and the payment didn't go through. Of course, you can add some tags and filters to the report to get it to show the right numbers... but shouldn't the sales reports show the right numbers without having to go through all these extra steps??\n\nThe interface is not intuitive - which is why you have to pay $2000 to hire someone to teach you how to use it (aka \"Kick Starter Package\"). What they don't tell you is if you have a lot of activity going out in your app, it gets slower and clunkier. So even if you're paying a pretty penny for more contacts and users, it'll still get more and more clunky and even slower. Each month, every sales rep in my organization has to take at least one day off due to this system slowness.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Keap:\nIf I had known all of the issues that I would have experienced beforehand and how dependent my business would become on such an unreliable system, I would have NEVER EVER considered Infusionsoft.\n\nBut if you have a small business (no more than a few hundred contacts) and do not sell a subscription product, it might be okay... Their marketing automation is cool when it works properly. But please DO NOT use their shopping cart.\n\nWhat problems is Keap solving and how is that benefiting you?\nIn theory, the things that you can do with the system to automate and make your business more efficient is amazing.
