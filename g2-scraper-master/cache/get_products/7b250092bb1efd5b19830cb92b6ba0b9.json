It provides excellent automation which reduces the hassle of manual work. Very efficient in terms of providing time management. Has a very supportive and dedicated team. Snapshot process is very helpful for post analysis. Segmentation shows each count and also helps to develop field values and queries. Works well with a number of data sets. Templates are easy to use. It allows SQL to be hand coded and also support exit points for custom code to be executed. Integration with IBM solutions is the best feature. It allows to schedule multiple campaign waves and provides access external data repositories from multiple sources. It allows an automated determination of appropriate content to offer, great functional capability. Great interaction and tracking abilities. Provides a standardized working process and a graphical user interface which is very easy to use.\n\nWhat do you dislike about HCL Unica?\nThe HCL Campaign SQL is a bit more meticulous than normal SQL. Lack of SaaS support. Schedules are difficult to manage.  Error log lacks detailing. Sometimes goes slow in loading. You have to switch between different platforms to access other tools. Editing sections is not very much ideal. It has some difficulty in managing the edits and also takes up time to become familiar with. The audience box should be enhanced. UI can be sluggish sometimes and needs to be improved.\n\nWhat problems is HCL Unica solving and how is that benefiting you?\nHCL Campaign is a very detail oriented software. Ideal for use in large size companies who have a lot of data to manage.
