We have our accounts grouped properly which helps us in running relevant campaigns and tracking the progress of each account. Since each account has more than 2 decision-makers, we have each contact segmented based on priority to offer more clarity to our sales and marketing teams.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Aritic PinPoint?\nUnderstanding all the features and using it real-time can be little overwhelming at first but once you have passed the initial hiccup, its all robust and smooth. I will suggest taking the demo and product tour. Their support team is very cooperative and will guide you through all the features. They infact will tell you which features will benefit you most if you tell them your end-goal.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Aritic PinPoint:\nIf you are looking to nurture enterprise clients, this is the best tool in market. It has all automation features, ABM, and social media marketing in one place. Also, Aritic PinPoint comes directly integrated with Aritic CRM.
