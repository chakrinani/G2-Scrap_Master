It seamlessly syncs our CRM data with our email marketing in a way we have been unable to previously. This provides a faster response than we had previously, making our touchpoints much more effective.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Sugar Market?\nNavigation can take a minute to get used to, and while it grows on you bringing new users onboard takes some time. Support can take a day or two to get back to us when we have unorthodox requests. Thankfully both are minor, negligible issues.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Sugar Market:\nIf you're already using SugarCRM (or Sugar Sell) then this is a no-brainer for a trial run. It's really pretty seamless. The onboarding process is in-depth and really worth the time investment. I'd also suggest bringing in at least two user for that training to help absorb everything and get the most out of the process.\n\nWhat problems is Sugar Market solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThe sync with our CRM is the most important issue. Previously we had time delays, issues with consistency, and hurdles over the size of the data moving between the two platforms.

It provides the core functionality for marketing automation and allowed us to expand beyond basic email marketing with lead scoring, event management, landing pages, etc. Also liked their business model a lot. Other vendors we evaluated were looking to charge per user (marketing and sales users) which would have limited our adoption and use of the product. Salesfusion unlimited user price model allowed us to get the functionality we needed and have the freedom to scale it throughout the company as we grew. New folks who come from using other solutions are always surprised that we can 'just add a user' when needed.\n\nDuring our initial evaluation, their native CRM integrations were a big plus as well. Other vendors were relying on 3rd party solutions or had limited access to the underlying CRM data. Connecting our marketing data to CRM was key for us to be effective and allows for easy targeting based on our full set of CRM data. CRM connection is clearly an area of investment for them as they continue to improve with dynamic lists and the upcoming campaign object support which will further allow us to leverage CRM data to drive our campaigns and effectively measure ROI.\n\nFinally, the item that has been the biggest positive for us is the support the Salesfusion team provides. The program is not without its issues and learning curve, but having the support team there to help makes us confident we can solve our problems quickly. Everyone I have interacted with in support has always been courteous and out to help us solve our issues as fast as possible. The support model and team Salesfusion has is definitely a huge asset for them.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Sugar Market?\nThey are in the middle of updating the platform which leads to some UI inconsistencies and confusion on which version of a feature to use when. They are cleaning things up steadily and the new capabilities are much improved just hope the transition will be completed soon. Also, wish Salesfusion integrated with more 3rd party platforms and services. We can and have worked around this through custom API connections (with their support teams help) but sponsored/managed integrations would be very helpful. We need to capture a holistic view of our customers and prospects. For our marketing automation system to be the true hub of that data we need to be able to collect and interact with all our customer touchpoints effectively. They recently updated their API which I am told will open things up for continued integration.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Sugar Market:\nIf you are looking for a tool that is on the rise and geared towards ease of use while still providing a lot of marketing horsepower Salesfusion is something you should consider. They may not be as well known as other competitors but their pricing (when we looked) was very favorable compared to other options and the capabilities were at least on par. Our experience with their support team has also been very positive which has been a huge plus for us.\n\nWhat problems is Sugar Market solving and how is that benefiting you?\nWe wanted an easy to use scalable platform that we could grow with. Our previous solution was solely email marketing focused and we wanted to move beyond that to encompass the full customer journey which Salesfusion helps us do through its capabilities and CRM integration.
