I feel as if my CSM is truly looking out for the best interest of our company and not just looking to onboard us for the money. I love the Sailthru Academy days and plan to attend everyone that I am given the chance to go to. When we have run into issues, the response time is nearly immediate and if what I am asking for isn't something currently available, Sailthru engineers create a hack for us and they note it for future product developments. I also love the flexibility with the drag and drop template builder. It is really intuitive and empowers the non-engineers on our team to use it freely. I actually used Sailthru at an old company as well before my current position at a new business. When our old contract ended, I vetting a least a dozen ESPs and selected Sailthru again.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Marigold Engage by Sailthru?\nI think that the overlays feature is still a work in progress and would like it to be just an smart as the template builder.
