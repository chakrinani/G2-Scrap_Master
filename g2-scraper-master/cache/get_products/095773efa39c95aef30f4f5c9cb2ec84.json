Next thing I knew the SWAT team had swooped in, and everybody was on deck to make sure I was taken care of.

The best I've used in 10+ years running my own businesses", "review_content": "What do you like best about Ontraport?\nOntraport is the best small business software out there, bar none. Flexible. Easy to use. Intuitive. And SUPER powerful.\n\nSince we've implemented Ontraport we have saved literally 0.8 of a staff member's time in admin and tasks (our previous platforms were SugarCRM). That's, like, $40,000 worth of saved time!!!\n\nI LOVE the fact that it is effectively an all-in-one solution that will be enough for pretty much any small to medium sized business. However, its potential is basically limitless if you need to do deep integrations with other systems too...so even the stuff where our business works 'out of the box' we are able to easily connect Ontraport to other platforms for highly specialised work.\n\nWhat else.....\n\nTheir Customer Support are phenomenal. The best out there. They are online, like 18 hours per day (maybe a little less on weekends) and you can call, chat or email in....and actually get  a real response, no matter how small the question. Their online Facebook community is like nothing I've ever seen too - responsive, supportive, funny...\n\nOntraport's dynamic CMS has allowed us to build all sorts of interesting web experiences for our clients, technology that you'd usually pay a lot more for but it's at everyone's fingertips. Love how this platform is constantly innovating and improving.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Ontraport?\nThe fact we can't do Postcards here in Australia is a bit of a pain, but that's related to an external integration (I'm guessing), so not really OPs fault.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Ontraport:\nThis product will change your business BUT you have to spend enough time working on it. Set aside a couple of hours to work ON (not IN) your account each week and you will reap the rewards.\n\nWhat problems is Ontraport solving and how is that benefiting you?\nWe have automated parts of our workflow that I didn't think were possible. We've integrated our marketing (e.g. Facebook ads) directly in with our client support (Ontraport's CRM features) so our business has become so much more streamlined.

However, its potential is basically limitless if you need to do deep integrations with other systems too...so even the stuff where our business works 'out of the box' we are able to easily connect Ontraport to other platforms for highly specialised work.\n\nWhat else.....\n\nTheir Customer Support are phenomenal. The best out there. They are online, like 18 hours per day (maybe a little less on weekends) and you can call, chat or email in....and actually get  a real response, no matter how small the question. Their online Facebook community is like nothing I've ever seen too - responsive, supportive, funny...\n\nOntraport's dynamic CMS has allowed us to build all sorts of interesting web experiences for our clients, technology that you'd usually pay a lot more for but it's at everyone's fingertips.

There are numerous predefined templates and alternatives to choose from. Also, there are excellent alternatives to testing that make it easy to spot what works and what doesn't. However, for those looking for more collaboration and tools to interact in real time, I'm not sure this is the way to go. We can more quickly perceive the effect that web and landing pages have on test requests. Although it's not simple to set up, there is a lot of data to collect to better understand which ads are working and which parts of our funnel need help. I like that everything is connected and easy to access from the same place. We have decreased the time lag between each customer visit, and increased the number of closed sales."}], "review_rating": 4.5, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "Florentino Rafael M.", "reviewer_job_title": "Senior Data Scientist", "reviewer_link": "https://www.g2.com/users/3a7917cc-7282-48c5-886d-4123882b8fb7"}, "publish_date": "2023-02-24T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Enterprise(> 1000 emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/ontraport/reviews/ontraport-review-7758618"}, {"review_id": 8035053, "review_title": "Excellent Service", "review_content": "What do you like best about Ontraport?\nVery easy to use.

A dashboard is available, but it lags behind similar competitors in this space. I found that the Tasks and task management settings aren't the greatest or easiest to use. Furthermore, my team and I opted not to use the Deals feature(s) for a similar reason. To track sales, we implemented our own custom updates using the Ontraport API. Managing duplicated contact records can be a challenge, as well. Finally, Ontraport seems to lack some of the features of enterprise CRM's and is desperately lacking in available integrations. Most anything you may want to integrate requires use of Zapier, which adds unnecessary complexity and cost.\n\nWhat problems is Ontraport solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThe problem we initially looked to solve using Ontraport is a dramatic lack of marketing engagement with our customers.

A dashboard is available, but it lags behind similar competitors in this space. I found that the Tasks and task management settings aren't the greatest or easiest to use. Furthermore, my team and I opted not to use the Deals feature(s) for a similar reason. To track sales, we implemented our own custom updates using the Ontraport API. Managing duplicated contact records can be a challenge, as well. Finally, Ontraport seems to lack some of the features of enterprise CRM's and is desperately lacking in available integrations. Most anything you may want to integrate requires use of Zapier, which adds unnecessary complexity and cost."}, {"question": "What problems is Ontraport solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "The problem we initially looked to solve using Ontraport is a dramatic lack of marketing engagement with our customers. We needed a way to market to and engage with our customers and track those interactions beneath the same roof. In addition, we relied entirely upon unsolicited, inbound sales to sell our product. With Ontraport, it enabled us to deploy a dedicated sales process and increase our conversions."}], "review_rating": 5.0, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "Chris A.", "reviewer_job_title": "Customer Success Manager", "reviewer_link": "https://www.g2.com/users/80e2cbea-1448-4714-a51f-4bf8a0599118"}, "publish_date": "2021-01-19T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Small-Business(50 or fewer emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/ontraport/reviews/ontraport-review-4561364"}, {"review_id": 4408425, "review_title": "Ontraport makes your business run better", "review_content": "What do you like best about Ontraport?\ncampaigns make it easy to keep things running smoothly behind the scenes\n\nWhat do you dislike about Ontraport?\nthe list doesn't automatically update for scheduled emails\n\nRecommendations to others considering Ontraport:\nIf you're looking for an all in one platform with outstanding support, Ontraport is a good place to go!\n\nWhat problems is Ontraport solving and how is that benefiting you?\nBetter automation than my previous email provider, better CRM, everything in one place, so no need for many apps", "review_question_answers": [{"question": "What do you like best about Ontraport?", "answer": "campaigns make it easy to keep things running smoothly behind the scenes"}, {"question": "What do you dislike about Ontraport?", "answer": "the list doesn't automatically update for scheduled emails"}, {"question": "Recommendations to others considering Ontraport:", "answer": "If you're looking for an all in one platform with outstanding support, Ontraport is a good place to go!"}, {"question": "What problems is Ontraport solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "Better automation than my previous email provider, better CRM, everything in one place, so no need for many apps"}], "review_rating": 5.0, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "NOT GIVEN", "reviewer_job_title": "NOT GIVEN", "reviewer_link": "NOT GIVEN"}, "publish_date": "2021-10-01T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Small-Business(50 or fewer emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/ontraport/reviews/ontraport-review-4408425"}, {"review_id": 4583617, "review_title": "Incredible technology with fantastic customer support.", "review_content": "What do you like best about Ontraport?\nMarketing automation for prospective customers, and communication automation to improve engagement with current customers.

An an all-in-one platform, their marketing automation functionality works seamlessly with the CRM.  Ontraport's marketing automation is best-in-class, which is a great accomplishment for a platform most have never heard of.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Ontraport?\nThe CRM itself is weak and clunky out-of-the box.  By default, contact records are flat, meaning there is no native functionality for one-to-many relationships such as accounts/companies hierarchy without custom configuration.  While such configuration is possible, it isn't intuitive and natural to use this add-on functionality for entities. Similarly, there is no native functionality to track \"Opportunities\" without creating this yourself.  As such the CRM functions more like a flat database of contact fields.  We began using Ontraport before they added entity relationships, so perhaps if we had signed on with such abilities at first, this would have worked itself out.\n\nEmails don't support dynamic, conditional content.  Sure, you can merge field values in, but you can't show/hide content blocks based on field values.  This limitation holds back email marketing effectiveness by forcing email campaign messaging to be hard-coded.\n\nThere are a lot of out-of-the-box reports, but it's not easy to deeply query the data to do business reporting natively.

Very easy to use once you understand the programs structure.  For me the key was to have Boolean logic at an affordable price in an easy to use package.

There is no graphing at this time so charts, etc. are not available.  You can get to the data fairly easily using a set of queries and the database is quite good so there is a lot of flexibility, but it is not readily available out of the box.

I love that all my programs can exist under one roof - especially since many of my clients end up purchasing several different program - and they can log into my membership site ONCE to access them all. Since moving to Ontraport, I've easily seen 3X growth in my business in the past 2 years {with my revenues moving from 80% 1 on 1 consulting to 80% online training programs}.\n\nUpdate August 2014 - At this time, after experiencing little to no support from Ontraport as my business continued to grow, I have moved to Simplero.com - a similar all-in-one platform with incredibly 1x1 support and personalized service.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Ontraport?\nOntraport has features upon features and I'm slowly learning them all! I really didn't have the time to master the software before using it... and that's been the greatest weakness. I'm thrilled to know that Ontraport is now certifying people to use it - I'm excited that my team will be able to become experts and it will be easier to hire people for specific projects.\n\nUpdate August 2014 - After spending over 2 years {that's over $7200} on Ontraport and never utilizing all the features, PLUS needing to hire developers to run my membership site, I've dramatically reduced my ongoing expenses with Simplero.com. It got to the point where I was looking at spending another $1,000 per month on a team member just to manage Ontraport.\n\nThe real straw that broke the camels back was the diminishing level of support. It seemed that as Ontraport grew, the \"personal super hero\" I was supposed to have on call dissapeared and I was left to figure a LOT out on my own.\n\nWhat problems is Ontraport solving and how is that benefiting you?\nWith Ontraport, I replaced 5 different systems that were clunky and held together with duct tape. Seriously - when you're building a business that depends on online programs being delivered, there is nothing worse than dealing with lots of support questions because access to a program wasn't delivered when they checked out... or realizing that a payment was missed and having to manually follow-up.
