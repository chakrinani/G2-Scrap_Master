A user can easily search for any type of content to fit their current need and use it without fear of legal issues.  The site offers multiple packages at different price points to satisfy businesses whether large or small.  The monthly payment allows the user to frequently use the site as much as they need to.  They also offer webinars to help the user with the product.\n\nWhat do you dislike about IntelligenceBank?\nI wish there were even smaller packages for smaller businesses with less of a budget.

We share this software across multiple offices, and we needed for all offices to be up-to-date with how to correctly source and manage digital assets. Not only did the Intelligence Bank team offer a great deal of support, but the software itself is fairly intuitive which meant our offices were able to get online and feel comfortable more quickly than expected. In particular, the keyword search bar at the top makes it easy to search for different assets - even new users can easily find their way around when logging in for the first time.\n\nWhat do you dislike about IntelligenceBank?\nThe download function has a lot of features, but it would be good if there was a way to select/compare photos before downloading. Often, I like to find as many relevant photos as possible for a particular channel or communication before selecting the best one. Rather than download all the possibilities and have to then file/delete them from my desktop, I'd appreciate having this functionality on Intelligence Bank. The bulk upload and desktop upload features are quite slow too - though it's hard to judge whether this is because of our own internet connection or because of software limitations. While I prefer using the bulk upload tool in order to add keyword/filters to assets at the time of upload, it can be frustrating that there's a limit on the number of files able to be uploaded in one go.
