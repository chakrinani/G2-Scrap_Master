The drag and drop interface for campaign setup is easy to use and features many options in order to create effective customer journeys. The built-in rendering preview is amazing! Reporting on results is extremely extensive, giving both numerical and visual representations of campaign performance. The team are friendly and always available for support and advice, whatever the issue!\n\nWhat do you dislike about RedEye?\nI find that the interface as a whole can be a bit clunky and unintuitive, with multiple paths to the same functions, from opening campaigns to viewing results. Some menu options seem completely redundant, like the 'email' option under campaigns (I'm not sure what this does or how this differs to the 'campaign list') or the template manager which doesn't seem to be useful for anything. Other options seem broken or in need of an overhaul, like the image manager which only allows one image to be uploaded at a time and then won't let you preview it or view the image URL to copy and paste into external HTML docs. Managing dynamic content can be tricky without applying it to an email first, and managing dynamic content rules can be difficult, especially when working in teams of multiple users. I also feel like the Redeye team have the capability to do so much more than the frontend of the platform will allow, but the only way to uncover these services is to ask or wait to be told about them (although the team does tend to be very proactive in communicating with clients!)\n\nRecommendations to others considering RedEye:\nThe platform really does allow you to work in a way that suits you best. It allows easy access to basic functions for beginners but give you the option to access advanced functions and everything in between! There aren't a lot of bells and whistles initially (there are some that you can request and the Redeye team are always willing to help) but the doors are really open for you to get creative with your campaigns!\n\nWhat problems is RedEye solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThe segmentation tool within the platform makes it really easy for us to reach out to the right customers without the need for database exports and excel spreadsheets (as we were often relying on before!)

The drag and drop interface for campaign setup is easy to use and features many options in order to create effective customer journeys. The built-in rendering preview is amazing! Reporting on results is extremely extensive, giving both numerical and visual representations of campaign performance. The team are friendly and always available for support and advice, whatever the issue!"}, {"question": "What do you dislike about RedEye?", "answer": "I find that the interface as a whole can be a bit clunky and unintuitive, with multiple paths to the same functions, from opening campaigns to viewing results. Some menu options seem completely redundant, like the 'email' option under campaigns (I'm not sure what this does or how this differs to the 'campaign list') or the template manager which doesn't seem to be useful for anything. Other options seem broken or in need of an overhaul, like the image manager which only allows one image to be uploaded at a time and then won't let you preview it or view the image URL to copy and paste into external HTML docs. Managing dynamic content can be tricky without applying it to an email first, and managing dynamic content rules can be difficult, especially when working in teams of multiple users. I also feel like the Redeye team have the capability to do so much more than the frontend of the platform will allow, but the only way to uncover these services is to ask or wait to be told about them (although the team does tend to be very proactive in communicating with clients!)"}, {"question": "Recommendations to others considering RedEye:", "answer": "The platform really does allow you to work in a way that suits you best.
