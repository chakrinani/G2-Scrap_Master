Silverpop didn't understand and rather than fix their routines, turned off the send on our account, send us an communication indicating bots had filled our email lists with invalid contacts, blamed us for issues, and denied everything. This was on top of the fact that over the 3 years we have been with them, the key features they sold us on still have not materialized and been made available to my company. They continue to report -0- errors in transmissions, refused email accounts, and other hard-bounces  on 1.5M email addresses on a daily basis. Their service failures and outages are routine, and they seem to reboot the servers rather than track the issues down."}, {"question": "Recommendations to others considering Acoustic Campaign:", "answer": "They will work, if you are technically inclined, can invest the time in debugging and understanding their platform and your emails are not mission critical."}, {"question": "What problems is Acoustic Campaign solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "Delivering our digital periodicals to customers on demand."}], "review_rating": 0.0, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "NOT GIVEN", "reviewer_job_title": "NOT GIVEN", "reviewer_link": "NOT GIVEN"}, "publish_date": "2017-04-26T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Mid-Market(51-1000 emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/acoustic-campaign/reviews/acoustic-campaign-review-277263"}, {"review_id": 649755, "review_title": "WATSON Rocks", "review_content": "What do you like best about Acoustic Campaign?\nFrom what I heard, WATSON will be the future of everything,\n\nWhat do you dislike about Acoustic Campaign?\nSecurity Concerns, would like to know more about WATSON security.\n\nWhat problems is Acoustic Campaign solving and how is that benefiting you?\nCustomer service in general.", "review_question_answers": [{"question": "What do you like best about Acoustic Campaign?", "answer": "From what I heard, WATSON will be the future of everything,"}, {"question": "What do you dislike about Acoustic Campaign?", "answer": "Security Concerns, would like to know more about WATSON security."}, {"question": "What problems is Acoustic Campaign solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "Customer service in general."}], "review_rating": 4.5, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "NOT GIVEN", "reviewer_job_title": "NOT GIVEN", "reviewer_link": "NOT GIVEN"}, "publish_date": "2018-03-20T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Enterprise(> 1000 emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/acoustic-campaign/reviews/acoustic-campaign-review-649755"}, {"review_id": 570742, "review_title": "IBM Watson Campaign Automation is a powerful email and marketing automation platform!", "review_content": "What do you like best about Acoustic Campaign?\nScalability of the platform, performance is fantastic.

It has very basic functionality that a simple email tool have but it also lack the very basic functionality of a email tool for eg. changing time of a scheduled campaign.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Acoustic Campaign?\n1. Automation of campaign is complicated and time consuming.\n2. You Cannot reschedule a campaign. You have to unscheduled a campaign and do the complete process again. Every simple email marketing tool have this function that a scheduled campaign time can be changed but not in silverpop. You have to go through the same process of creating and scheduling a campaign again.\n3. You cannot make changes in a automated campaigns. You have to cancel that automation and then again do the same process. Automation is meant to decrease the work load and optimize the automated campaign by changing the subject line, small changes in content etc. But you cannot do that in silverpop.\n4. You cannot make any changes in a scheudled campaign, Like changing subject line, content etc.\n5. Loading time. On every step of silverpop you will have to wait and see the pop ups and progress bar coming in. That is frustrating and irritating.\n6. Email deliverability - They does not take care of IPs, they will give you IPs to handle yourself, You have assign the ips yourself to each and every query and segments you create. An inexperienced person who is new to email marketing may spoil the IP and domain reputation.\n7. Support - support team takes there own time to answer your request and their support is not available on saturdays and sunday.\n8. Report tabs. If you have a large database and you have already done many campaigns then report tab will not load at all. It will keep on loading and suddenly it will show unexpected error occurred.\n\n\n\nRecommendations to others considering Acoustic Campaign:\nIf you want to automate your email marketing, Recommendation campaigns etc. Do not go for silverpop at all. Even if you want to use silverpop as a bulk email marketing tool then also I will not recommend it because the deliverability team of Silverpop is not experienced and they will let you handle your IPs which is dangerous. Even if you go for 5-6 IPs for your organization they will not rotate the IPs, You will have to manually assign the IPs to each and every query. But they will pool the ip for rotation if you insist.\n\nWhat problems is Acoustic Campaign solving and how is that benefiting you?\nI have been into email marketing from last 7 years and have used N number of tools but this is the worst tool I have worked on.

You have to cancel that automation and then again do the same process. Automation is meant to decrease the work load and optimize the automated campaign by changing the subject line, small changes in content etc. But you cannot do that in silverpop.\n4. You cannot make any changes in a scheudled campaign, Like changing subject line, content etc.\n5. Loading time. On every step of silverpop you will have to wait and see the pop ups and progress bar coming in. That is frustrating and irritating.\n6. Email deliverability - They does not take care of IPs, they will give you IPs to handle yourself, You have assign the ips yourself to each and every query and segments you create. An inexperienced person who is new to email marketing may spoil the IP and domain reputation.\n7. Support - support team takes there own time to answer your request and their support is not available on saturdays and sunday.\n8. Report tabs. If you have a large database and you have already done many campaigns then report tab will not load at all. It will keep on loading and suddenly it will show unexpected error occurred.\n\n"}, {"question": "Recommendations to others considering Acoustic Campaign:", "answer": "If you want to automate your email marketing, Recommendation campaigns etc. Do not go for silverpop at all. Even if you want to use silverpop as a bulk email marketing tool then also I will not recommend it because the deliverability team of Silverpop is not experienced and they will let you handle your IPs which is dangerous. Even if you go for 5-6 IPs for your organization they will not rotate the IPs, You will have to manually assign the IPs to each and every query. But they will pool the ip for rotation if you insist."}, {"question": "What problems is Acoustic Campaign solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "I have been into email marketing from last 7 years and have used N number of tools but this is the worst tool I have worked on. It is complicated, time consuming and irritating tool where you will see pop ups, progress bars every now and then. I would not recommend this tool at all.

Silverpop is a very dynamic marketing automation tool. It has all the features that you need to run a simple marketing campaign to automated complex behavior marketing programs. Silverpop has a very active user community that allows users to share ideas, flag bugs, put in support cases, and suggest new functionality for the development road map.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Acoustic Campaign?\nThe tool does not integrate with some popular 3rd party tools and the inbound and landing page reporting capabilities are not as strong as they can be. The interface can be challenging to navigate for new users and some of the org administrative functions and setup can be a bit confusing. The interface user experience has been greatly improved from the Engage B2B days as well as the functionality.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Acoustic Campaign:\nChoosing the right platform is a very important business decision. When choosing a platform you have to consider not only if the platform is right for you, but also if you are right for the platform. Do you have the internal resources needed to learn and utilize all of Silverpops functionality? Do you have the data to support the use of some of the more advanced features. If you have a database with less than 2,500 contacts and no database fields to use to create targeted queries and lists then you should consider a cheaper tool so you are not paying for functionality you will not be able to use.\n\nWhat problems is Acoustic Campaign solving and how is that benefiting you?\nMaking sure that the right audience gets the right message at the right time is essential to digital marketing. Having the right data and the right platform can make all the difference. I've worked with clients that were sending e-blasts to their entire database and worked with them to utilize the data that they had and Silverpops features to make their outbound digital marketing more targeted and effective.
