It's easy to create highly targeted, trigger-based automations to help achieve our business goals. Overall, it's an extremely versatile tool (one of the most flexible CRM/ESPs that I've ever used) that offers a huge array of customisation over how you use it.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Bloomreach?\nDue to its high level of customization, it can be very complex to understand how to use the various elements of Bloomreach to begin with. Even simple reporting and data analysis can be pretty complicated until you've gained a good understanding of the reports, aggregates, running aggregates, segmentation tools, etc. I've been using the tool almost daily for approximately 4 months, and there are still elements that I struggle to completely understand.

We try to do things rapidly, and we don't need to ask for help to make things work, which sure is positive. But when we do need help, appreciate the support -- we get very prompt responses from our dedicated Customer Success Manager.

Exponea is also allowing a few more members of the team to actually get directly involved with sending campaigns, thanks to a user-friendly and straight-forward interface, and that saves us some time. A particular use case that became possible with Exponea is accurately cross-selling products. So if a customer comes in for one product, we can match their attributes and use predictive models to identify that they would also go for another product, and this lets us cross sell our products really nicely.

The product as the Customer Data Platform is remarkable and has truly allowed us to have a 360deg view of each and every customer that shops with us. They call this attribute the true Single Customer View and I think the word \"true\" describes it very well. We are able to leverage this regardless of how our customers engage with our brand. We can understand each of them much better and have a view of context, whether the customer is engaging with us online, or even offline. I have to say the icing on the cake is that we are now able to segment against the customer profiles that Exponea have created. With this we are able to trigger campaigns across ALL of the channels, and do so on the fly. We are able to give our customers a consistent, omni-channel experience. Exponea ensures the right messaging and at the right time for all of our customers. It's been incredible! The team are equally as fantastic and it's been a pleasure working with each of the members. This has been the first instance where I've seen the quality continue from the sales pitch to integration to post integration. It's difficult to say that about other tools that are out there these days.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Bloomreach?\nFor me, this is actually a tough one to answer, as Exponea excel in almost every aspect. In terms of improvement areas, I think that the most beneficial would have to be for Exponea to explore some advanced onsite search capabilities. But really, the tool is constantly evolving so I imagine this is already on the team's radar.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Bloomreach:\nEnsure your end users are involved in the migration and scope documentation. Seeing how the events/attributes are structured in Exponea is invaluable if you are going to also be setting up campaign activity.\nThe best piece of advice was actually given to me by another customer and that was to make the most of their Integration Consultants - they are incredible and treat your goals as if they're your own - they are experts at translating your business requirements into use cases within Exponea and also take into consideration so many other things to make sure you get the most out of the integration from the start.\nEvery employee has the same amazing attitude and they really believe in creating loyalty, even more fitting for the field they're in.\nWe're already looking at further integrations and implementing it's use across the business due to the insight we can gain from it.\n\nWhat problems is Bloomreach solving and how is that benefiting you?\nExponea has definitely helped alleviate a few critical pain points as well as help us optimize areas in which we focus heavily on. The first that should be mentioned is that we now have a self-managed technology that provides a holistic single customer view, again it's a pretty great feeling to understand our customers (online & offline) better than ever before.

They are allowing us to personalize at scale. Sofology are a customer-centric company and it's been fantastic working alongside the Exponea team who are customer-centric themselves.

It solved many issues for my company and the staff was incredibly helpful with any issue I had. Even though some scenarios were too complex to be handled just by me, I had help from all over, from the help centre to the designated person who is managing our account. The platform has great features and with a bit of knowledge of the front end, many amazing results came out of the collaboration with Exponea. The fact that we can make segmentation for the users who did not open the email and approach them again in order to determine them to receive the information is great. As well, the fact that we made several weblayers and we created some rules for them helped us from giving too much information to the customer. Also, segmentation of the web layers came in handy during some specific promotions because we were able to show one banner for those interested in a brand and another banner for those interested in the competition. I believe we are using just a small part of what Exponea does, but we already see results regarding the kpi we follow.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Bloomreach?\nThere is nothing I dislike personally, but what could be considered an impediment in using all the customization features, automation and reports is the lack of knowledge of the user. The ways the platform works is quite intuitive, but when it comes to more complex tasks it is not so handy to accomplish them. Exponea completed many pages with step by step information since we started our collaboration so I would say that things are going into a good direction. However, at this moment I still believe no one could just log in on the platform and use it right away at its full potential.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Bloomreach:\nIf you are not using Exponea you should do it because you have all the information you need in one place. You can do reports and see what metrics you should focus on, or see in depth the results of your actions. As well, you can create complex scenarios which create a path for the user from the first moment he subscribes till the first purchase and so on. Through the automation, you could put the client in the focus of your business. You can send personalized messages for the birthday of the user or its name day, you can send a voucher to activate the user or inform those interested in some particular activity of your website that you have a dedicated promotion.\n\nWhat problems is Bloomreach solving and how is that benefiting you?\nWe had rather low open rates and recently we started working on scenarios including best open time which improved our results significantly. Moreover, the segmentation we made for different brands (as being an online retailer) helped us better reach the user. We recently connected to the Ads accounts and we are going to implement soon this feature too which sounds amazing.

You have to spend some time diving a bit deeper into the knowledge base of things, that are not necessarily part of the daily business. This adds a bit more of tasks to all of us on the team but the more you know the more effective you are with the tool, obviously."}, {"question": "What problems is Bloomreach solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "We are able to execute highly personalized campaigns more rapidly. We pinpoint our targeted segments through ram storage and tracking diversity, which has offered a significant conversion rate optimization. Our team has had increased productivity through not having to be dependent on the IT team. We are able to use weblayers and experiments, and this has allowed a significant reduction in the manual work for the content department, through the opportunities that Exponea's marketing automation offers us.\n\nOn top of that, we have been much more effective in our efforts and are really enjoying the omnichannel communications with our user base. We have a much higher open rate now, as the message comes to each customer when they are most probably going to open it.

I worked with so many different tools before that, but Exponea is the most complex because it's capable of integrating analysis, emailing, SMS and Facebook messages. This makes it so much more easy to design multi-channel campaigns, automate, test and evaluate the results, all in one place. To me, this is a huge benefit.
