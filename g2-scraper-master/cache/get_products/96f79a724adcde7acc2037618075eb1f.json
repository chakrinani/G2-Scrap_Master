I like how there is a more customizable option for those who know code and a simple version for those who like to plug and play. I like that you can see click heatmaps. I like how you can get a wide variety of statistics from your emails and how easy it is to organize your campaigns within Iterable. I like how easy it is to create lists within Iterable and how simple it is, but also how complex it can get for stricter targeting. I think Iterable has been great for sending bulk emails for our business. I think it also has a lot of capability that we haven't fully used yet.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Iterable?\nOnly thing I don't like is how you can't see how many clicks you got from sections that send an email compared to those that send someone to a website. E.g. If I have a tile linking out to a landing page, you are able to see this on the heatmap. If I have a photo that leads to an email to send to our business, you can see how many overall clicks the email received, but it doesn't show you which tiles had those clicks and how many individual clicks each tile has on the heatmap.\n\nWhat problems is Iterable solving and how is that benefiting you?\nIt allows us to make automations for customers we want to keep in constant contact with. It also helps us set up reminders for customers when they are expecting service from us. It allows us to create messaging that is personalized to our customers. It allows us to be creative and test different things out, but also allows us to be successful in those tests. It allows you to really personalize what you want to do, and how you want to do that. For automations, we can test different things. For bulk emails, we can test different things.
