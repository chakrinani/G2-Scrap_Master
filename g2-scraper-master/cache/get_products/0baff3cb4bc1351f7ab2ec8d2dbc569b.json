If you spell something wrong or do not put the correct spaces, it says no records found.\n\nRecommendations to others considering LeadMaster:\nThe whole concept of leadmaster is great! Just have to understand and thoroughly know how it works and how to update it properly so it can work efficiently. If employees are all updating it differently, it will not work correctly. Just make sure you train your employees in the area and implement the importance of it.\n\nWhat problems is LeadMaster solving and how is that benefiting you?\nIt helps with leads that we have and what area we need to focus on.
