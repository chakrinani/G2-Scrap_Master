I use, for example, \"ingaia\" software that is niche app for real estate business that does not have an open api.\nCreating automation flows is also easy with lots of features. User history with all tracked information including pages visited and conversions made are also very useful.\n\nWhat do you dislike about RD Station Marketing?\nThe main problem for me today is that the client can only be identified by email address. Nowadays, i talk to my customers via messaging apps and usually all I have is their mobile number. But without email information I cannot identify such user in the system.\nAlso many features could be more refined and have more possibilites, the landing page creation for example should be more flexible and have more models to choose from (if i want to do things from scratch i can build my own landing page, but that`s what paying RD for). There is no mobile app to check how things are on the go. The price tier increase hugely with the number of contacts you have, but as I grow my base I believe it is getting too expansive as I am not seeing the return I get from the platform with the same rate as price increases.\n\nRecommendations to others considering RD Station Marketing:\nI do recommend RD Station specially for inbound marketing and emails campaigns. If creating campaigns to drive customers through you funnel using email and segmentation based on user behavior is what you are looking for than it is good. Also you may consider that if your users base is growing fast the price increase of the solution may become a problem.\nIf you pretend to use just \"some\" of the functionalities, you may find less expansive tools to do the job. For a \"hands on\"  and more flexible approach you could look for \"mautic\".

RD Station allow us to capture lead from landing pages, integrations with my facebook leads ads, my website and my crm (witch is integrated with many real estate advertise platforms).\nIt allows me then to engage the users through the funnel using marketing automation flows, sending emails, tracking users on the site, tracking conversions from integrates software creating segmentation.\nAlso, we use it to integrate various software, including crm software, messaging, facebook ads, google analytics, and others.", "review_question_answers": [{"question": "What do you like best about RD Station Marketing?", "answer": "RD Station has many integrations with other apps, specially Brazilian apps that usually are not so easily integrated with other automation tools as many of them don`t have an open api.

This brand recognition is helpful to sell to the client why they should subscribe to this system."}, {"question": "What do you dislike about RD Station Marketing?", "answer": "Their pricing scheme could be a little more competitive, seems that RD has decided to focus only on the bigger companies leaving no room for small fish.\nSometimes, the interface changes can be a little confusing: some features that you are used to have in one area disappear, hidden under some other menu; or they change places with no indication of where they are now; or are renamed/no longer exist.\nAlso a problem with their interface: it may require too much training for clients that aren't very tech savvy. Working in an industry with plenty of clients who barely understand why generating leads is important, showing them how to navigate RD Station and what is going on was such a bother that we have to create easier to follow graphs elsewhere, which could be resolved through focusing on a little more intuitive design in this department."}, {"question": "Recommendations to others considering RD Station Marketing:", "answer": "Keep in mind that it may not have the pricing scheme you need right now, but if your business is headed in the right direction it may turn out affordable very quickly.\nWhile they don't have a free version, their trial has enough time for you to figure out whether it is what you need or not (specially if you can look up their training videos)\nIt is a very big platform in Latin America, but I do not know whether or not support for other languages is there yet."}, {"question": "What problems is RD Station Marketing solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "We needed a platform that could manage all our email marketing and funnel leads from landing pages to a database. It checks all those requirements and does it well.\nSince we work with many different clients, we needed to offer them a service that works, is recognizable to them and has a good reputation in their eyes.\nHaving started to use RD Station, we no longer needed to worry about managing lead generation and were no longer using many different software to do all the functions that were required to keep producing credible results to our clients.\nSince it has many features all gathered in one place, we were less worried about having to constantly keep track of what we were offering to clients, if it was going to be affordable to them while also being manageable by us."}], "review_rating": 4.0, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "NOT GIVEN", "reviewer_job_title": "NOT GIVEN", "reviewer_link": "NOT GIVEN"}, "publish_date": "2018-07-06T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Small-Business(50 or fewer emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/rd-station-marketing/reviews/rd-station-marketing-review-761794"}, {"review_id": 1129451, "review_title": "Help me a lot", "review_content": "What do you like best about RD Station Marketing?\nRD Station is a good tool for companies that want to increase brand awareness or sells.\n\nWhat do you dislike about RD Station Marketing?\nIf i need to give a feedback i would say a more friendly home in the tool, more information in the first page.\n\nWhat problems is RD Station Marketing solving and how is that benefiting you?\nI'm generating much more leads, i gained more time to analyse data.", "review_question_answers": [{"question": "What do you like best about RD Station Marketing?", "answer": "RD Station is a good tool for companies that want to increase brand awareness or sells."}, {"question": "What do you dislike about RD Station Marketing?", "answer": "If i need to give a feedback i would say a more friendly home in the tool, more information in the first page."}, {"question": "What problems is RD Station Marketing solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "I'm generating much more leads, i gained more time to analyse data."}], "review_rating": 5.0, "reviewer": {"reviewer_name": "NOT GIVEN", "reviewer_job_title": "NOT GIVEN", "reviewer_link": "NOT GIVEN"}, "publish_date": "2018-11-08T00:00:00", "reviewer_company_size": "Mid-Market(51-1000 emp.)", "video_link": null, "review_link": "https://www.g2.com/products/rd-station-marketing/reviews/rd-station-marketing-review-1129451"}, {"review_id": 1362460, "review_title": "Eu gosto muito da RD, mas da pra melhorar, sempre da <3", "review_content": "What do you like best about RD Station Marketing?\nCriador de landing pages e segmentacao de leads.
