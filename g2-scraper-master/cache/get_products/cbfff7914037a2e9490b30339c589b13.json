She is great to work with and has helped build our sales eco-system.\n\nI have also been very impressed with the photos that Wishpond has created for the marketing efforts. They are professional capture the essence of what we offer.\n\nWishpond has also demonstrated their expertise with different marketing methods including Facebook and Google Merchant. With their help I have been able to set up a Google Merchant shop. It is amazing how complex it is getting to use these different tools and having someone with expertise to offer suggestions really help\n\nLastly, everyone we have worked with at Wishpond had been pleasant and responsive.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Wishpond?\nMissing insights Marketing cost to Sales. Sales have lagged at different times and it is not clear as to why. I know this is a pretty hard thing to measure but it would be of great help.\n\nThere also seems to be a lag between campaigns. Prior to using Wishpond we were doing our own social media advertising and we had a pretty steady flow. When we started using Wishpond we saw a big jump in performance but then lags. In looking at the data those lags line up with the gaps between campaigns. I just wonder if we should be doing other things there.\n\nAnother thing is that we are continuing to run some marketing efforts in parallel with Wishpond for a number of reasons. We try to coordinate as much as we can but the efforts feel very separate some times. Perhaps this is something we need to discuss more in the coordination meetings.\n\nLastly, I cannot tell when campaigns actually start. That is probably an issue from my side but except for Alethia telling me there is no indicator. I do get the weekly updates but do not see what is actually going out. I think for Drip campaigns my team should always be included.\n\nWhat problems is Wishpond solving and how is that benefiting you?\nWe started with Wishpond to improve our digital marketing presence. Initially we had a big boost in sales but that has leveled off somewhat.\n\nWe also wanted to add more professional marketing approach which includes campaigns (regular and drip). I think the pictures and layouts of the landing pages have added to this.\n\nAs part of this we wanted to grow our base. Alpine Labs had a large email list (>55K) but we suspect that it was mostly existing users. One of the goals is to get to new targets. We believe that working with Wishpond has helped but so be honest we are not completely sure.\n\nThe biggest problem we are worried about is growing sales.

She is great to work with and has helped build our sales eco-system.\n\nI have also been very impressed with the photos that Wishpond has created for the marketing efforts. They are professional capture the essence of what we offer.\n\nWishpond has also demonstrated their expertise with different marketing methods including Facebook and Google Merchant. With their help I have been able to set up a Google Merchant shop. It is amazing how complex it is getting to use these different tools and having someone with expertise to offer suggestions really help\n\nLastly, everyone we have worked with at Wishpond had been pleasant and responsive."}, {"question": "What do you dislike about Wishpond?", "answer": "Missing insights Marketing cost to Sales. Sales have lagged at different times and it is not clear as to why. I know this is a pretty hard thing to measure but it would be of great help.\n\nThere also seems to be a lag between campaigns. Prior to using Wishpond we were doing our own social media advertising and we had a pretty steady flow. When we started using Wishpond we saw a big jump in performance but then lags. In looking at the data those lags line up with the gaps between campaigns. I just wonder if we should be doing other things there.\n\nAnother thing is that we are continuing to run some marketing efforts in parallel with Wishpond for a number of reasons. We try to coordinate as much as we can but the efforts feel very separate some times. Perhaps this is something we need to discuss more in the coordination meetings.\n\nLastly, I cannot tell when campaigns actually start. That is probably an issue from my side but except for Alethia telling me there is no indicator. I do get the weekly updates but do not see what is actually going out. I think for Drip campaigns my team should always be included."}, {"question": "What problems is Wishpond solving and how is that benefiting you?", "answer": "We started with Wishpond to improve our digital marketing presence. Initially we had a big boost in sales but that has leveled off somewhat.\n\nWe also wanted to add more professional marketing approach which includes campaigns (regular and drip). I think the pictures and layouts of the landing pages have added to this.\n\nAs part of this we wanted to grow our base.

However, there is actually an additional cost above the annual fee when it comes to attempting to have a truly successful campaign -- due to the social platform algorithms, unless I put money behind my contests to boost posts and run ads, nobody sees the contest is live and conversions are small, if there are any conversions at all."}, {"question": "Recommendations to others considering Wishpond:", "answer": "I would not necessarily utilize this product unless you're intending to run more than one contest a month.

Creating A/B split tests offers the possibility to discover new preferences your customer base might have when it comes to shopping, browsing, interacting with your brand. The ability to edit a campaign while it's running lets us make adjustments and last minute calls based on immediate outcomes and any unplanned changes.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Wishpond?\nFolders to organize social campaigns would be a nice additional feature. Possibly adding a template that is nearly minimal and can be manipulated to match branding more closely.\n\nRecommendations to others considering Wishpond:\nWorth the investment, even just for running social campaigns. My favorite feature is the ability to duplicate campaigns! Reduces the time it takes to create copy, as well as making it simple to improve upon and replicate already successful campaigns. Changes can be made while a campaign is active, which eliminates the need to re-post any shared content down the line. Support is so incredibly helpful! The Live Chat feature has saved me the stress of launching a campaign we're unsure of. Any emails I've sent in regards to platform issues or additional information on internal automation have been answered in a timely manner.\n\nWhat problems is Wishpond solving and how is that benefiting you?\nWe're currently utilizing Wishpond's services to promote a new brand and gain new contacts across all social media platforms via use of the Sweepstakes campaign tool. Wishpond makes it easy to monitor our sweepstakes performance, integrate sharing, export leads/contacts, and get creative with our campaign aesthetics!

The ability to edit a campaign while it's running lets us make adjustments and last minute calls based on immediate outcomes and any unplanned changes."}, {"question": "What do you dislike about Wishpond?", "answer": "Folders to organize social campaigns would be a nice additional feature.

My favorite feature is the ability to duplicate campaigns! Reduces the time it takes to create copy, as well as making it simple to improve upon and replicate already successful campaigns. Changes can be made while a campaign is active, which eliminates the need to re-post any shared content down the line. Support is so incredibly helpful!
