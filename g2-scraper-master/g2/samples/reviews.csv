1204,RoboForm,https://www.g2.com/products/roboform/reviews,4776544,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about RoboForm?
Roboform is available on all platforms and is integrated tightly ont he varying operating systems.  On IOS on my iPhone I am able to easily utilize RoboForm over Apples own solution.

On the business side - i can easily control who should be in which groups enabling seperation of duty.

What do you dislike about RoboForm?
Would like to have even a small (100MB) shared secure file area in addition to shared notes for items that need protection but better managed as a file than a shared note.

Would like to be able to have a single log in that lets me switch between multilple RoboForm accounts.  I am an administrator across multiple companies and logging in and out is inconvenient.

Recommendations to others considering RoboForm:
Relying upon browser or OS specific password stores is not a viable long term solution.  RoboForm has been around for years and is rock solid.

What problems is RoboForm solving and how is that benefiting you?
Storing all of my passwords and key items that need protection yet available from wherever I happen to be.  Managing who can see what is very helpful.",5.0,"Name: Ken G.

We have few office PCs and few iphones we use for work and we do like that it works cross platofrm well.
We used it for few years now and it's worth the money. It's not super compatible with all computers and maybe it's not as secured as some of the other software, but for an average user like us, it solved a lot of my business problems in keeping all of our 100s of logins in one place.
We got used to it quickly and we use it on daily basis.
It was easy to set up and install it on all of our devices so that helped a lot. The online sync between devices is a nice feature and its easy to see what device takes priority when there are conflics in passwords.
Overall, we are happy with the product and I thinks its worth the money. They came a long way in the last few years for sure.

What do you dislike about RoboForm?
I wish it would have face ID on our iphones to log in quickly and I know we have some compatibility isses with android phones and PCs, but for the most part, we got it all worked out and its sufficient.
I'm not sure if different employee access is available to limit what they can see as far as passwords.

What problems is RoboForm solving and how is that benefiting you?
We keep a lot of logins for 100s of customers devices and it would be imposible to easily track all of that. The software makes it very simple and I like that it prompts us to save when we log in. Makes it easy not have extra steps.",3.5,"Name: Peter H.

I use Roboform everyday for work. It's very easy to add new users and use across multiple platforms. The browser extension is a great tool. It's a secure way to store and share passwords for an individual or enterprise use. Users are easily integrated and may be given access to creditials with the option to either allow them to update/edit them or give them no access to change or view the credentials and only use them.

What do you dislike about RoboForm?
Differientiating between folder use and user groups doesn't seem so clear. Even after extensively reviewing their online guides, from an enterprise perspective, I would like to be able to save certain credentials to a folder, and then share that folder among users and/or groups. Intially,  had issues with the browser extension ""not connecting"" which made me believe my password was not input correctly. I would have to go directly to the website in order for the extension to connect correctly. This was resolved when I downloaded the desktop application. No longer had issues with executing the browser extension.

It's always on, for any website it's able to pop up and suggest my saved password. I like the password generator too, it's fully customisable and saves me time to use strong passwords. Moreover, I like the way I can organise my thousands of passwords in folders and use notes. I think there are plenty of other features I never used, and will. I also use the personal profiles utility, very useful when I have to subscribe to new services or register to a new website.
Another feature I appreciate is that I can synchronize my devices, so I'm always sure that wherever I'm creating/modifying a password it's automatically saved on my computers and mobile devices. I use it everywhere and daily (my job is 100% computer-based, so I start to use passwords early in the morning and end late in the evening, without a password manager I would be lost in a few minutes.

What do you dislike about RoboForm?
What I think could be improved is its integration with local applications, not web-based. I know it's an hard task but sometimes it has been able to intercept and provide me the passowrd for appliation too.

Roboform makes it exceptionally simple to add login information for all of our clients in a secure platform that only our team can access. The automatic nature of the login capture provides oversight for even the least likely among us to save login information. It also gives an opportunity to save all of the information in an organized way with layers of access for different roles.

What do you dislike about RoboForm?
For our clients, it would be great if they could easily share their credentials directly into the software. I would like it to be simpler to set up 2 factor authentication through Roboform - or to have technical help to set this up forsome of our accounts. This is the biggest sticking point for us and would make a world of difference for our team. An easy way to find duplicate logins would be helpful as well.

Roboform has been a consistently solid password manager for many years.  I like how easy it is to use both in the browser and the mobile app.  Customer support is always very helpful.  The security checkup feature allows our users to see which of their passwords have been exposed in breaches.  We use the program every day and would be lost without it!

What do you dislike about RoboForm?
Sometimes duplicate passcards get created if the users aren't paying attention when saving updated credentials.  This causes confusion because they don't know which version to use.  It would be nice if there was a feature that allowed them to scan for duplicates and choose the most current set of credentials.

I love how useful it is.  I have been using it over 20 years.  I ported everything over from Gator.  I use it on all my devices.  I store logins for everything, using the password generator to create complex unique passwords for all sites.  I moved client passord lists from Outlook to Roboform Safenotes many years ago.  I have a personal Safenote storing my list of medications to use at doctors offices.  I love how well it works with all Windows devices.  It is so easy to install and get working on all devices.

Roboform enables me to do what password managers do best:  easily secure passwords for my accounts and log into them with a single click.  I use Roboform every day and it was seamless to setup for my team.  I can leverage their Safenotes to store additional information, similar to any other note taking tool.  I'm even able to search my individual notes when I know what I'm looking for.  I use Roboform for Business, and as an admin I find it very easy to manage all the accounts.  A nice feature that comes with that are Share Groups that allow for granular access configurations, enabling sharing of passwords & SafeNotes in a safe and effective manner.  To top it all off, Roboform has never been involved in a breach, which gives confidence that my critical information is safe.

What do you dislike about RoboForm?
My biggest complaint with Roboform comes from the Business side of it, specifically when using the mobile app.  When I first sign into the mobile app, I am unable to view any notes/credentials/etc that are located in any shared groups.

Password Management: RoboForm securely stores an unlimited number of passwords, ensuring you don't have to remember or reuse them across different sites.

On iOS/Android it made it so easy and convinient to log on to my accounts.

RoboForm does a great job allowing large teams logins, without giving all the team members access to the actual login details. So you can have access to many different logins at scale, without compromising the security of the logins.

It's also very easy to quickly create secure passwords on the fly, and save logins. It's also easy, for those who have the permissions, to grab login information for use in an Incognito window, or similar, when troubleshooting.

What do you dislike about RoboForm?
RoboForm doesn't do a perfect job recognizing the domain for logins, and can suggest incorrect logins if the URL path doens't match exactly. This also means that when filling out an internal form within a software, it may just suggest dozens of incorrect logins for the page, even though it's not a login field. Or, on a password change page, it might

From a user perspective, it's unclear whether I can save personal passwords into a private area, without my employer seeing those passwords, unlike other PW managers.

RoboForm would regualrly correctly log me out after certain conditions were met (as per my organization's policy), but would then fail when logging back in (after submitting the 2FA), citing that my credentials were wrong. But just entering them again worked 100% of the time. Login issues with a PW manager are always a tad worrying.

I appreciate that I can store bookmarks (URLs), login credentials, encrypted safenotes, and identities (for form fill-in) all encrypted for me individually and for corporate use can then share out the same to individuals or groups!

It also has a Security Dashboard to show password age, redundancy, etc.

What do you dislike about RoboForm?
Creating a new login identity is difficult on a mobile device.  I find it much easier on a computer.  Sometimes a website and an app do not match for username and password fill in (the login can be located and manually told to fill in, so it does work).

Norton Security is an advanced antivirus program for your PC. The antivirus offers incredible assurance against malware, ransomware, wholesale fraud, and web and email assaults.

These high-level highlights are just accessible as a feature of an expensive bundle, so we need to pick as indicated by our necessities. The estimating plans are sensible, and the security is fantastic. One of the most dependable brands and names in PC security.

What do you dislike about Norton Antivirus?
What I like least with regards to Norton Antivirus is that its installment plans can be thought of as costly and it doesn't have multi-permit valuing. In such a manner, I suggest utilizing Norton Antivirus for enormous organizations or then again on the off chance that you work with new applications and sites constantly.

It uses a lot of RAM which can cause slowing down the performance of the computer.
By clicking on uninstall, removing each setup file of antivirus is a tedious task.

Norton's VPN is horrendous.. it dials back your web association with a slither. Likewise, their VPN needs to be turned on physically every time you reboot. It doesn't remain on. I quit utilizing their VPN because of the web speed issue.

What problems is Norton Antivirus solving and how is that benefiting you?
We use it for first-line security programming that guards against phishing endeavors, infection connections, trojans, malware, and so forth It's strong security programming for the little and mid-market business.

I've had applications before like Avast where there have been consistent pop-ups that aren't even useful, and it's fundamentally ""advertisements"" attempting to get me to refresh to a high membership bundle to get the best infection insurance. Norton doesn't mess with you like that, and we should you update on your own choice. It runs behind the scenes and some of the time you neglect it's even there!

We are approaching the six month mark of being on board with this software company and wanted to review our experience thus far.

The sales team was very systematic and professional.  Our salesperson, Lori Grass was thorough in assessing our needs and made sure she understood our goals and challenges before giving us a customized proposal.  She hit the perfect balance of moving us along in the sales cycle while patiently addressing our questions and concerns.

We spent a month carefully comparing ROI to several other providers of marketing automation software and chose ROI based on two main factors: flexibility and service.

The other providers had standardized products with little ability or willingness to be flexible to address our particular needs.  We would be required to fit into their system with little customization possible.

When we read the reviews of the different products on G2crowd.com, the comments consistently touted ROI’s strong focus on providing fast, attentive customer service.  We have found this to be true in our six months with them.  Most small/medium issues are addressed the same day and we receive communication if an issue will take more than 24 hours to be resolved.

Once we signed the contract, we were passed to the onboarding team who immediately scheduled with us.  I’m sure many have experienced the frustration of being put on a lengthy hold once the ink was dry.  This was not the case here.  We were scheduled to pass the information needed to setup our account the following week.

We got a good example of the personalized service offered when our unique configuration warranted the attention of Amol Dalvi, the CTO of the company.  I am doubtful that any of the other marketing automation companies we reviewed would have devoted the time of their chief technology officer to our unique needs.

Once we became familiar with the basic functions of the software, we were referred to the customer success team to help us plan how to get the most out of our purchase.  Several team members worked with us regarding our two distinct client bases to understand how to implement a Life Cycle marketing program, attracting and retaining customers while moving them along a continuum of engagement.

We pledged to utilize all of the functionality of the software and are well on our way to making good on that promise.  The customer success team has been extremely responsive to our perhaps greater than average number of requests for guidance and clarification.

What do you dislike about Right On Interactive?
One note of caution:  Although the sales team in no way misled us into thinking that “marketing automation” is literally “automated,” requiring little or no effort, we can see how the term could mislead a marketing department to believe that this is a “turn the switch and go” product.  In order to fully utilize the functionality of this comprehensive software package, the purchasing company needs to be fully committed to spend the time and dedicate staff to understand and implement the software.

Recommendations to others considering Right On Interactive:
Do your due diligence and research the other marketing automation platforms that are out there.  We believe that the ability and willingness to customize their product around the client's needs coupled with their excellent customer service will lead you to make the same decision we made, ROI!

What problems is Right On Interactive solving and how is that benefiting you?
One application that we chose to implement required some detailed and complex programming, as we wanted to contact a representative of the prospect, instead of the prospect him/herself.  Technical Project Manager, Suzanne Zaleski spent the better part of a week parsing code to accomplish this request.  With it, we have implemented a campaign that allows us to recruit previously lost business with a series of emails 90/60/30 days from the prospect’s annual renewal date as well as a series of two phone calls – all pre-programmed and automated.

In summary, although we have only scratched the surface with what is possible with this software, we have made steady progress with the readily available assistance of almost every department at ROI.

We are incredibly pleased with our purchase and plan to continue to dig deeper into its functionality to enjoy all of the benefits of marketing automation and Lifecycle marketing.",5.0,"Name: Mark S.

The top three points where ROI stands apart -

*Really do listen to your feedback for product development
*You are assigned an account manager who helps with both the short term needs and long term strategy as well as very quick, helpful assistance through a ticketing system if they are not available.
*Ever changing product - A different product from what it was a month ago, year ago, etc. They do keep an eye on what's out there, as well as listen to user feedback, and are constantly making changes and additions to improve the product.

There are so many things that I like about ROI. First, the software is flexible and user-friendly (easy to navigate). I truly appreciate the campaign builder feature because it enables me to physically see and understand the logic/flow of my email marketing campaigns. Designing emails in ROI is also simple (ROI offers an array of templates to choose from, but you can easily create your own, too). The reporting tool is another feature I enjoy because I can quickly gather data on any number of things within any of my email campaigns.

Secondly, I really value the ROI team (business development, client success, IT/development, etc..). They're good people to work with every step of the way (customer friendly and very focused on helping us achieve success). My company had an aggressive timeline for implementation, and the team at ROI worked hard and communicated well with us to keep the project on schedule. I'm so impressed at how consistent they are in responding quickly to any inquiries that myself or my marketing team has.

What do you dislike about Right On Interactive?
I really  don't have any major dislikes. However, I would gladly welcome an update to the software that would allow the user to be able to back out of the page he or she is in without having to start at the home page in any general section.

Full disclosure: Right On Interactive was a client and we've used the product for another client of ours.

We've been working with Right On for the better part of 4 years, and they truly were the pioneers of customer lifecycle marketing and the software reflects that. This is not simply a marketing automation platform; it is tailored to educate and assist marketers at every level of their lifecycle, which, in turn, serves their customer lifecycles.

What I like the best is the ability to scale with this product. Even if your organization is just ready for email marketing and landing pages, the software can be used for that, while introducing the layers of advanced analytics (like engagement scoring) at those stages. Once you're at a point where you can advance to the next level, it's easy to do so.

I also like the recent UI and UX changes. The product continues to improve because the team listens to customer feedback and wants to create a product people want to use.

What do you dislike about Right On Interactive?
While the product has improved, there are still some UI and UX considerations they need to take into account. They also need to expand and invest in integrations, but I've been told they are already working on those.

Recommendations to others considering Right On Interactive:
I'd recommend being dedicated to the on boarding process and setting timelines for yourself so that you can use the product as efficiently and effectively as possible. If you don't make it a priority, then you won't use it to its fullest extent and your marketing will suffer as well.

Also, stay in touch with your client rep. They are so incredibly helpful and will make sure you're set up for success.

What problems is Right On Interactive solving and how is that benefiting you?
I'm getting more eyeballs on my client's content and giving them names and emails of people who are highly engaged, which creates a seamless transition for sales and marketing.

In addition to the typical features you expect from a marketing automation system, ROI has a really unique contact lifecycle tool - it helps you visualize (and build segments) on your contacts in their various states of development. Best part of that: the GUI is drag-and-build. As the executive sponsor, it's important that I be able to USE what we have...I don't want (nor can I justify) a full time headcount for an Eloqua or Marketo expert to do tricky stuff.

We also love the fact that they are affordable AND very customer-focused. As with any sophisticated platform, there is a learning curve on our part and the ROI team goes above and beyond their service level agreement to make sure we are happy and productive on the system.

Finally, we love that the worked with our existing systems (SFDC, DiscoverOrg) immediately and we don't have to do a lot of bouncing around to get work done.

What do you dislike about Right On Interactive?
As with innovative platforms like this, there are always little things we would like to see on the roadmap. While the team does their best to address our needs, we have *on rare occasions* had to wait for a feature. That said, we are a small company without a lot of pull so we would expect the wait time to be double or triple if we were dealing with the bigger vendors.

We are several months into a transition to Right On from another solution. The onboarding has been excellent and the level of service and responsiveness is excellent. Their team is very well versed in their product and how to make it work for your particular use case. The solution itself is robust, allowing us to create the segments, content and programs we need to advance our strategy. I particularly like the lifecycle approach and the visualization tools that are encompassed within it. I believe that, over time, they will prove extremely beneficial to us in driving adoption and increasing revenue across our entire customer base.

What do you dislike about Right On Interactive?
ROI is building out additional functionality currently that I believe will improve the effectiveness of lead generation (such as progressive profiling, which just rolled out) that I think will enhance the usefulness of the tool. The lack of some of these functional elements to date, while not major roadblock to our implementation, has caused us to work around their absence. I believe that most of these will be addressed in upcoming releases.

Recommendations to others considering Right On Interactive:
I would suggest speaking to them about your specific use case and exactly what you are trying to achieve through an implementation. They are very good at identifying how the solution can work within the framework of your particular business challenges. I also highly recommend that you ask for referrals.

very customizable - you can create your own clinical content for documentation, as long as you know how to do that!

What do you dislike about Centricity Practice Solution?
too much: it's not an out-of-the-box solution, so you need to purchase products from other vendors to make it a complete EMR (e.g. document scanning, two factor ID, patient portal, order interfacing, claims scrubbing), and these different components require their own maintenance and will often break down (or need massive amounts of rebooting) after an upgrade is installed; there's no search capability within the main part of the EMR; lab interfaces are not built in; e-prescribing was a mess and the new fix (DrFirst) is onerous to say the least (got rid of all our medication custom lists, and their new replacement for this -- called ""Favorites"" -- is subpar); by far the biggest issue is how difficult it is to allow team-based care with this EMR (two people can't be in the same chart update at the same time, lots of pop-ups come up when there is simultaneous work, inbox work distribution not feasible); athena owns the product now so the product support is much better than GE, but it's a broken product and athena knows it - I wonder how much longer they will support it versus just ask folks to switch to the main athena EMR. Can't wait to be done with this EMR and switch to Epic.

I love the chance that centricity gives to healthcare providers to perform their best and document everything needed in a chart as best as possible. The way Centricity lets you chart is unmatched. However, it can be tricky when first training if you are not familiar with the program. What is helpful about centricity is that it is a good program to keep charts and do charting simultaneously. The upsides of using centricity are the ability to see schedules and charts all in the same application.

What do you dislike about Centricity Practice Solution?
Centricity is not the best application for medical records and charting. It can be hard to understand where everything is located, and it will take some time to learn the application and its system thoroughly. I believe that if the application looked more pleasing and was more interactive this would benefit the user. It can be tricky for users to find out where everything is within centricity (such as labs and other important values).

Centricity is helping businesses in healthcare by making it possible to chart easily and making it easy to see multiple schedules at once so that doctors do not miss patients and so that everything in the clinic flows smoothly.

My passion lies within the revenue cycle arena.  With this in mind, I am pleased with the process of getting encounters through the system and paid.   The scheduling component is very good, easy to setup and use.  Centricity Analytics is also my best friend.  I want to be able to run reports on various elements and this application allows me to do so.   The patient portal is excellent too.   Easy to use for patients.   We also have online bill pay and many other modern features.

What do you dislike about Centricity Practice Solution?
The greatest issue is the fact that we are not on a cloud based system that would allow for more abilities with the web and interfacing.   It is coming soon with Project Northstar but it can't get here fast enough.  I believe there is still room for improvement when it comes to form utilization and workflow processes.

The system works. In 6 years the amount of downtime is probably 6 hours.  I have worked on or consulted with over 10 PM systems and GE is one of the best.  There are some problems and preferences that I have or that are orthopedic specific that we could improve on, but there are some sacrifices that must be made or are just quirks of me.

What do you dislike about Centricity Practice Solution?
I dislike that in many of the data entry field areas (payments, charge entry, etc.) that you cannot do a heads down data entry without using the mouse.  This slows done the process for fast keying of data, along with the fact there is inconsistency as to when you tab vs when you use the arrow keys to move fields.  There needs to be a better method for viewing patient payments in the Billing/Financial screens and seeing how many statements have been sent out to a patient.  The Reports have a lot to be desired and are almost worthless, so we outsource a monthly data dump to a 3rd party to get very effective reporting.  The scheduler setup functionality needs a MAJOR overhaul...once setup its fine...but with multiple providers & locations & service types that change frequently it is an overly difficult process to make even the simplest change.

Recommendations to others considering Centricity Practice Solution:
Would recommend as a good solid solution for a mid to large sized practice.

What problems is Centricity Practice Solution solving and how is that benefiting you?
Centricity helps us bill & chart patient care.  We are able to manage our business with a normal number of employees.

The system is very flexible in how you can use it.  It allows you to tailor the experience to your clinic and not to a boilerplate template that other EMR's use.

Sometimes the best thing is also the worse thing.  It can be confusing how to do things in the system unless you have a great training policy to make sure that end users are using the system in the way that your practice wants it to be done.

Centricity Practice Solutions or CPS has provided us with a platform for a vertical build.  It has seamless interoperability.  It is a flexible system that allows you to develop the workflow that works for your practice.   Our EMR and PM are connected.  We  do not need to have so many add on products -- such as superbill for capturing our office charges.  Yet, the system allows us to add on products to automate many processes.  The system continues to allow us to use progressive technology, such as capturing patient histories, and faxing office notes out every night to PCPs.  Centricity EMR has greatly increased the practice productivity and assist the physicians in providing quality office care.

What do you dislike about Centricity Practice Solution?
In order for a system to be flexible it can be complicated.  People want out of the box solutions for complex medical practices and that just doesn't work.   When I talk to someone who is complaining they have not set something up correctly.  We spent the time and resources to build a workflow that works.  The end result is we see more patients with much better documentation.  But to build that custom workflow took time and money.  End results we have a product our providers and staff like.  One item we don't like is how spell check works on the system, we think this could be improved.

Recommendations to others considering Centricity Practice Solution:
Other systems may look cheaper but you end up having to pay others to what you can do in this ystem

What problems is Centricity Practice Solution solving and how is that benefiting you?
Our Account Receivables are outstanding, we break every benchmark and have very high results. Business problems like tracking with plan need a authorization, insuring the insurance verification is completed, posting payments quickly and identifying underpayments.

Observation terms is a very powerful tool that allows us to not only be more productive but able to produce outcome results.",5.0,"Name: Deb M.

For a site that is essentially free (unless you opt to buy more credits- which I haven't as I have no problem with sharing much of the content found on the site) you won't pay a penny and get a decent amount of shares of your content.

Some sites have their images hosted on another domain so we can't request pins for their content.

The fact that it serves as a great resource for launching content to a global social media audience. A lot of the community on this website is comprised of professional internet/social media/content marketers. So the community that uses this software are some of the brightest in the business. Because of that, its really cool to see who shares your content and helps spread things viral.

What do you dislike about Viral Content Bee?
There have been times when I submitted content that was not approved, even though it was editorial in nature. To that end, make sure your content is high quality and relevant to a wide audience before you submit. Also, there are probably some categories that could be added. All in all, however, I quite enjoy this tool and the 'likes' far outweigh the 'dislikes'.

Recommendations to others considering Viral Content Bee:
Make sure your content is actually worth sharing before submitting it to Viral Content Buzz. Add a hashtag to your titles - it helps their viral spread on Twitter when you use this service.

We use Informer mainly as a reporting tool for Colleague by Ellucian which is a Unidata environment.  Unidata does not lend itself to reporting friendliness.  There is no way to join files together other than manual means.  With Informer, we don't have to import files into a separate environment.  The software connects to our live data.  Once the file structure, not data, has been recognized by Informer, then we can join files together in Informer.  So starting in one file and then selecting on data or using column data from other files is very simple.  Without writing custom programs for each report, this functionality is just not available in Unidata.
We use Informer with our Unidata environment along with a small bit of SQL.  Once the files and tables are set up in Informer they are completely environment agnostic.  They all look and operate the same and can be used together.

What do you dislike about Entrinsik Informer?

Recommendations to others considering Entrinsik Informer:
This has been a tremendous time saver for us.  Not only decreasing the time for report development but also enabling users to create their own reports.

What problems is Entrinsik Informer solving and how is that benefiting you?
We use Informer for ad hoc reporting.  The one-and-done reports are usually quick to develop.  We also use it for enterprise reporting that is used in summary or detailed form.  One of my favorite features is the ability to schedule a report.  I have users that want to see a fresh report at the same time every week or month or quarter.  It is very easy to schedule the report to run and then email the results.
We also have situations where users don't need to see all the available data so Informer allows us to create limited views of the same files that might contain sensitive data.  For example, we can report out of the HR module of our software without exposing compensation data to users that don't need to see that information.
As a university, we use the same software to report on enrollment, academics, alumni, fund raising, financial services, human resources, etc.  Reports are developed and then it is very easy to share those with either individual users or with groups of users.",5.0,"Name: Jamie S.

3791,Datanyze,https://www.g2.com/products/datanyze/reviews,1772182,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about Datanyze?
It's an easy-to-use, powerful tool, that provides accurate data. It integrates with some of the other marketing-related systems we use, so it makes the gathering data extremely efficient. I also like the pace the Datanyze team comes up with improvements, i.e. new features.

What do you dislike about Datanyze?
Nothing springs to mind. What would make it even better is a wider range of third-party apps it integrates with, but it isn't really an issue for us at this point.

Recommendations to others considering Datanyze:
There is no risk involved in trying out the free version of Datanyze. Just add the fre Datanyze Insider extension to Chrome to get a glimpse into how it works. Although this will not offer you the full functionality, it is pretty convincing. They also offer some other free tools, if I'm not wrong.

What problems is Datanyze solving and how is that benefiting you?
We use Datanyze to collect new technographic data and update existing data for accounts. While this can be a number of ways, we found that Datanyze saves us a significant amount of time doing so. We also use it to find prospects and their email addresses, although that's less relevant to us as a use case.",5.0,"Name: Matt D.

BrightLocal has a ton of options, all of which appear to be useful for somebody attempting to rank SMEs on Google at a local level. The interface is reasonably intuitive and navigation between applications is quite easy. The onboarding videos (Bright Academy) are among the best I've ever used. The support can only be described as superior.

What do you dislike about BrightLocal?
There isn't a lot to dislike. As an agency, I'd prefer more options with white labelling. I believe the platform would benefit from administrators being able to exert more granular control over user groups, although, in fairness, there is a workaround that goes some way toward solving that (relatively minor) issue.

What problems is BrightLocal solving and how is that benefiting you?
BrightLocal provides a wide range of usable information that allows users to correctly optimise websites, Google Business Profiles, Google Maps, Local Finder and citations. It also provides excellent tools to gather Google reviews, post to GBPs and numerous other time-saving functions. The reports generated by the system can be shared with customers, with a decent (although imperfect) degree of white labelling. Overall, it solves a wide range of problems that anyone attempting to rank locally in Google organic search might reasonably encounter.",5.0,"Name: Tony G.

There are some bugs here and there but on the other hand, I've used far more expensive systems and they have bugs as well.

Easy user interface and tons of great insights once you activate all the modules. For two years, we also used it for our reporting and analytics.

Over time we found the reporting not granular enough for our SEO needs. But that was after we became more sophisticated in our analysis. It was great the first few years.

To manage Google Business Profile, Bright Local offers cool features like a local search ranking checker, a tool to track citations that also tracks NAP consistency, GBP audits, and local SEO audits. It also helps manage reputation by monitoring GBP reviews and getting more reviews. We can also integrate Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, and Google Business Profile Insights with it to track leads in one place. It also allows us to track competitors' performance.

The main dashboard, which is Locations Overview Dashboard, is not so good. It looks messy, unorganized, and unoptimized at times. Locations are not displayed in a good way, but that doesn't play any big role.

4035,Sked Social,https://www.g2.com/products/sked-social/reviews,9419408,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about Sked Social?
I've used most social media management tools, including HootSuite, Later, Content Cal, and Sprout, and I'm consistently blown away by the robustness and value of Sked Social. I use it to manage my roster of 8+ clients.

Sked fills gaps where others fall short with auto-publishing to Instagram Stories, TikTok, and Google Business while covering all of the essentials on Meta platforms, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Twitter (and probably more — these are just the ones I use). They also have product tagging for Instagram, which is essential for me as I work with DTC e-commerce brands.

Possibly the biggest game-changer is Sked's approvals flow. My clients have been on a tour of approvals processes with me and we all agree, Sked's approvals process is the most user-friendly and best for team collaboration. My clients also love the ability to have their grid in their bio link with Sked Link as well as the aesthetic customization options of Sked Link.

I like the built-in AI tool for caption writing and am excited to explore Tags to gain more powerful insights and inspiration.

This review wouldn't be complete without recognizing Sked's support team. Anytime I have an issue, they get back to me within minutes, which is above and beyond any support I've received from other platforms.

Sked costs a tiny fraction of what I was paying for an agency plan with Sprout and hasn't left me hanging in any major ways. I recommend it to all of the social media managers I know.

What do you dislike about Sked Social?
I'd love to see insights for more platforms (currently they are available for Meta platforms and LinkedIn). I'd also like to see Total Reach for Meta platforms as the reports currently show daily reach which doesn't give the whole picture, so I have to hop into Business Manager for that.

One feature I miss from another tool I used is a post link click report for the link in bio. I'm confident with UTMs and use them as Sked recommends so I can see the data in GA4. But this is quite a learning curve for some users and it helps to have a visual representation of which posts are getting the most clicks. One of my clients particularly misses this feature.

What problems is Sked Social solving and how is that benefiting you?
Sked saves me time by auto-publishing more media types and on more platforms than other tools. (Who wants to stop what they're doing to post a story? I don't!) The analytics reports save me a ton of time every month. The AI caption inspiration feature cuts my content creation time as well.

Sked's approvals flow has been a game-changer. Paired with the fact that you can have unlimited users, I can collaborate with my clients and their teams and share the content calendar with anyone who wants to see it.",5.0,"Name: Jenessa S.

4035,Sked Social,https://www.g2.com/products/sked-social/reviews,9409646,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about Sked Social?
I have been with Sked Social for about 3 years now and use it to run my clients' accounts everyday.

I do not have to pay to have more members on my team. The price depends more on the number of accounts I have. Despite this, they're very generous with the number of accounts you can post on with even the most limited features. I enjoy the fact that I can set everything to auto-post and has a lot of nifty features like client link reviews that make my social media management process easier.  Their analytics section is super in-depth as well.

They are constantly improving based on their customer feedback which I really appreciate. They've reached out to me several times during my early days with them and have implemented some of the suggestions I've mentioned.

What do you dislike about Sked Social?
In the beginning, there were a lot of issues with account connectivity but I've been seeing that happen less more recently. Because they're always trying to add better features, I understand that this can cause some inconvenience to a lot of social media managers. It's great to know that if you reach out to customer support, they're very responsive and work with you to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

I wish there were more analytics outside of Facebook and Instagram so I don't have to leave the site to do my reports but it's not too big of an issue since most of my client base deals with Meta.

4035,Sked Social,https://www.g2.com/products/sked-social/reviews,9409681,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about Sked Social?
The best part of Sked social is the attentiveness of the customer support. I have used the chat to receive help, add accounts, and more and have gotten my problems solved in minutes. If I've ever needed a solution they couldn't offer, they've called me and collaborated to create them. I also like how they are constantly improving and adding new features. Beyond a scheduling tool, it's an approval tool, a internal team communication tool, a community management tool, and an analytics tool. My team and clients have adopted it quickly.

What do you dislike about Sked Social?
I'd argue that for my team there are no major downsides to Sked. However I would like it if it integrated better with other apps, such as our project managment software, Wrike, or our copy calender in Notion.

What problems is Sked Social solving and how is that benefiting you?
Sked allows me to post on multiple social platforms for my 40+ clients at a price rate that is affordable for my small to medium sized marketing agency. It saves my team time from having to schedule natively in each individual client's account center on Meta. It gives me greater control of who has access to what page and to make sure nothing unapproved by a client gets posted.",5.0,"Name: Vanessa S.

Sked is the first scheduling tool I've used that has a well thought out process for client approvals, simplified with the use of a link you are able to send to clients for smooth sign off. Sked is very simple to use and I love the format of the calendar and planner views, it's a pleasant way to plan content, I also love the built in AI tool when I need some ideas for captions. The customer support is great with a handy chat box in the platform itself and emails are always responded to asap, we also have regular updated on new features or changes.

What do you dislike about Sked Social?
There are the occational glitches where posts aren't published and alt tags aren't always included in Instagram posts.

Sked is an easy scheduler for all major social platforms. We primarily use it for Instagram but started using it recently for Pinterest too. I love that you can tag products to make the posts shoppable from the app. You can also post stories. I believe they have actual people posting it in real time for you - so they are able to get all the tags, products, swipe ups in. It also has great analytics, a queue, and a shoppable URL.

What do you dislike about Sked Social?

The first thing that attracts me to this service is the price structure. The second thing is the amount of features you get for the price. Zoho Meeting comes with all the bells and whistles that any business would require. Its tiered pricing structure, based on the level of participants, makes it ideal for small or new companies to start using this service immediately. It seamlessly integrates well with other Zoho solutions, such as Zoho Mail, which makes it a doddle to schedule meetings. The sound quality is high, providing you with good connectivity. The video streams are sharp and crisp, depending on your connectivity. Overall, ease of use is straightforward, with training always available and documentation that helps walk you through all those features if you require. Customer support is amazing to the point that when you leave feedback after use, they actually read it and respond quickly. It's easy to implement and you'll find yourself using it regularly due to this.

What do you dislike about Zoho Meeting?
The thing I dislike about Zoho Meeting is the audio in meetings can sometimes become degraded. When I informed Zoho of this, it was looked into immediately, and some adjustments were made, which seemed to have remedied the problem. Another annoyance is the quality of the background feature. If not in a good spot, it will make you disappear in part to reveal any activity that may be happening in the background.

I love the pre-designed elements that make it very easy to have a good overview of a project with detailing, dimensions, line weight all embedded within the components you chose from the catalog

What do you dislike about Vectorworks Landmark?
I dislike the fact that as you chose prefab components, they are very difficult to edit. You cannot customize most of them or if you do it is highly complicated to have them edited both in 2d and in 3d. I have not yet found a good workflow with non traditional designs.

Recommendations to others considering Vectorworks Landmark:
This software does not have an plugin option to add python or scripting which is probably lacking. I feel like Revit and Rhino and other very good softwares to use with a greater learning curve and move possibilities but I love the graphics and ease of use of Vectorworks.

5318,Vectorworks Landmark,https://www.g2.com/products/vectorworks-landmark/reviews,550599,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about Vectorworks Landmark?
Landmark is an easy to use CAD software that is compatible with other CAD programs, which allows for collaboration with other professionals, and also has great rendering capabilities to generate legible plans.  Great tech support, too! The program is set up differently than AutoCad, but once the structure of the program is figured out, its fairly easy to take it from there.  Importing other files types has been easy, too, such as adding aerial photos, pdf or jpeg images as backgrounds and supplemental information on the sheet.  Its nice to be able to lay everything out in one program and be able to seamlessly update the plans as changes are made.

What do you dislike about Vectorworks Landmark?
Getting other CAD files to import properly can be challenging.  CAD blocks need to be exploded to get the basic line work to be modified in some cases.  I have had some issues with large files crashing, but there are a lot of program updates that keep the software working and compatible with other software.

Recommendations to others considering Vectorworks Landmark:
Give it time to learn the software and utilize tech support to help figure it out.  There was a steep learning curve at first until I figured out the organization of the program, but from there its mostly intuitive.

What problems is Vectorworks Landmark solving and how is that benefiting you?
Landmark tools are really easy to use to draft and design.  Even the basic tool set allows for a lot of flexibility in designing even organic shapes and hard geometry.  There are a lot of options to render drawings- adding transparent hatches and colors to add texture and value to an otherwise black and white drawing.

This is definitely the most versatile and powerful CAD program at the best price.  Not cheap, but it transformed my workflow and the quality of my presentations to clients.  Once you get used to thinking in objects instead of lines (as in, drawing the wall, not two parallel lines), it allows for fast and effective 3D design that is particularly readable.  As a Landscape Designer, I don't think there's another program that can model the landscape as well and give you such a realistic model of the site.  Not only can 'walk-thru's' and 'camera shots' give the homeowners a clear and appealing presentation of the proposed design, but while designing you can see how things will, or won't work.

What do you dislike about Vectorworks Landmark?
Mastering Vectorworks is a real mountain to climb.  This is no simple Sketchup type program.  I have several colleagues who worked through training manuals to learn VW, but most needed several days of intense training courses to begin to get it.

Recommendations to others considering Vectorworks Landmark:
Take a look at several finished, rendered 3D landscapes and compare the effectiveness.  I saw a real difference that made investing in VW worth it (and that investment was cost and time to train).  See if the program you are considering and comparing will give you complete cut/fill calculations (VW does) or see how many schedules are built-in.  Those are the big time savers.

What problems is Vectorworks Landmark solving and how is that benefiting you?
After completing the planting plan in Vectorworks, the program generates a complete and accurate plant list/count/budget.  It's an unbelievable time-saver that clients love.

What do you dislike about ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus?
A defect that I do not like about ADSelfService, which I do not know if it is with the system itself in the way it has been implemented here. But when a user authenticates himself, he enters his username and domain, as well as a CAPTCHA, once they have done this, they go to the next screen where they enter their security questions and make another CAPTCHA.
Once they have completed the security questions, they will go to the last page, where they again have to complete a CAPTCHA without any reason before resetting or unlocking their account. I feel that the third CAPTCHA is unnecessary.

Recommendations to others considering ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus:
If you are looking for a solution that suits, is powerful and sticks with a large number of additional applications, then ADSELFSERVICEPLUS is what you want. This software is very powerful, but you will need some patience at the beginning when dealing with its support. They are sharp, but from time to time they tend to jump the gun when they solve problems, making sure they are allowed to make changes. If you have a strong change control policy, you will want to make this very clear to the support team.

We have been using this software for some years and we are satisfied with the result you have given us.

Proprofs Poll Maker is an excellent tool for creating and sending simple polls. It may not be as advanced or have as many options as TypeForm, Survey Monkey, or even Google Forms, but it's simple and straight to the point. I especially enjoy the option to create personality quizzes (as a French teacher, I find this particularly engaging if I can relate to French content).

What do you dislike about ProProfs Poll Maker?
The only thing that ""dislike"" (and I hesitate to use that word) is that there are only three options for creating polls on this platform: 1) a simple, one-question poll; 2) a quiz; and 3) a longer form survey. That's not really something I dislike per se, but it's just not as varied as other platforms can be. However, if you're going for a simple, straightforward poll maker, this is the one to use! Emphasis on straightforward!

Recommendations to others considering ProProfs Poll Maker:
Definitely stick to the free version first, before considering or moving towards the paid subscriptions; there is already quite a bit that is useful and effective even with just the free activities/games/quizzes/formatives.

What problems is ProProfs Poll Maker solving and how is that benefiting you?
ProProfs is great for any sort of formal or informal formative assessments with my students.

The plattform is also fairly easy to use, and while it let the user really dive into complicated task, it also present the data-driven fact in a matter everyone understand.

Siteimprove Customer Support is verry professional and ""always there for you"". They are handlng the tickets in a fast rate, and their responses are always understandable.

To get Siteimprove up and running as a matter of adding one line html-script. The ease of integration is indisputable.

What do you dislike about Siteimprove?
What I dislike about Siteimprove, is that it is ""Desktop only"".
Kind a contradictory as the Content Suite are there to hand the quality of Accessibility.
So as a user, u better use Siteimprove on desktop only, and your screen needs to run a fairly high resolution if you want to get the most out of the platform.

Several times I just wanne bring up my phone to check the state of one of my pillar pages.
How's the numbers regarding KPI og Key metrics? Is the SEO and Performance good enough? How about Quality Assurance? These numbers and patterns are not really showing on a mobile. Not for me pushing 50 year old :)

Speaking of mobile. I would love to use Siteimprove Marketing Analytics on our Native Apps for IOS and Android.
Giving the support of API, and the world is basicly App-first-driven, I think it's a shame a world wide platform as Siteimprove doesn't support App tracking. Not out of the box and not as a seervice thru their API.

I like most about AvantLink the fact that you can pinpoint certain publishers to get more or less of a percentage payment, depending on their relative value. Some publishers also require a platform such as AvantLink.

PolyEdit has very favorable features such as its support for different languages, frames and environments. It should be noted that plugins can be installed without additional costs such as lineEdit.

PolyEdit is an easy editor to edit, delete or open large files. It has a simple interface with many features, with a design similar to Notepad ++. The advantages of this editor are the compatibility with different programming languages and their search functions.

PolyEdit is a simple and straightforward rich text editor and word processor. It has all the main features you would expect to get the job done. It's not bloated like Microsoft Word and it's very snappy. Unlike the page layout mentality of something like Word, PolyEdit focuses on the text itself. It's designed with writing and editing in mind.

Because of its slim and focused nature, PolyEdit is very easy to pick up and use. It will be very familiar to users of Microsoft Word, but even if you've never touched a word processor before, it shouldn't take long to start using everything in PolyEdit that you need.

Outside of the basics like font style, alignment, color, and lists that Word or Google Docs offers you, PolyEdit does have a few unique features. It has a tabbed interface so you can quickly and easily switch between working documents on the fly. It includes some great tools to work with text, including sorting, snippets, and a built-in clipboard manager. It also has a wide variety of plugins and additional tools available on the developer's site.

What do you dislike about PolyEdit?
PolyEdit hasn't been updated in a long time, and its design looks a bit dated. It still has all the features you need to get writing done, but it seems unlikely that any new features or fixes will be added in the future.

What do you dislike about BestRx?
Some limited features for our particular use (veterinary pharmacy).  Use of the ESC button exits out of the application completely - a habit several in our office had a hard timer remembering as we have another software that only pulls out of the active window for the same action.  Not a show stopper for sure, but if you have some less tech savvy folks who will be using the software, may be good to consider.

Recommendations to others considering BestRx:
This is a great solution for a small pharmacy or a practice with a small pharmacy inventory.  My recommendation is to go live with what you need 1st and then discuss with customer service (they are great!) and other features that can add to the usability.  Learning it all at once was a little daunting for some in our practice who are less technology savvy at first.  I have heard from some other I know who use the system currently that there have been some issues when the office switched over to Windows 10 OS, but we didn't use that, so maybe check with customer service to see if those are needed features or if they've already solved that if you're on that OS.

I like that it responds quickly to my input and helps to make many changes swiftly. It also links to my e-mail, and calendar to draw real world insights and ensure my clients and opportunities stay on track and don't slip through the cracks when things get busy. It serves reminders, and makes linking contacts and action to opportunity progress possible. Not to mention, the awesome tables and metrics on deal performance and much more.

What do you dislike about Xactly Forecasting?
I don't see many downfalls. If I had to pick, it would be the time it takes to sync updates and display them in the topOPPS tab. Occasionally, as network changes are made within your orginization, you may need to re-link e-mail and calendar. Again, not really an attributable fault. This platform is superb.

The forecasting feature has been my favorite and most valuable part of the TopOpps tool. Being able to forecast using both the current pipeline and additional pipeline that's expected to be generated is very helpful.

What do you dislike about Xactly Forecasting?
There's sometimes a delay in the sync with our CRM, but that's somewhat expected with Salesforce integrations. There's a ton of great information in TopOpps, but the downside is that it can be tricky for those who aren't regular users to identify key data points.

The Atriuum Integrated Library System has been a cost-effective, easy-to-use, and reliable product for our library since we switched to it in 2015. It has proven to be a great tool for a library of our size. There are more expensive ILS options out there that may have more or enhanced features, however, we find that Atriuum works extremely well for a library of our size serving a community of approximately 14,000 people. The hosting and maintenance have been easy and consistent. Technical support and sales are very responsive to questions and issues. They are easy to connect with via phone or email. Atriuum covers all the features that we need to see for a library of our size and there are optional modules/services you can subscribe to that will enhance your services or increase options if they are of use to your library. Our library is open 7 days a week so Atriuum is in frequent use every day for a variety of tasks from adding new materials, managing materials, checking items in and out, and helping patrons discover what we have in our collections. The recent up to a new version of the OPAC called Gallery completely updated the somewhat dated design and layout and looks excellent. Atriuum is happy to help with questions on how to use or implement features, how to run reports or create custom reports, and how to configure and setup items to work best with your workflow. For areas where we have suggestions or would like to see new features they take enchancement requests and prioritize them based on demand. There are regular updates supported by release notes to highlight new and updated features and fixes.

What do you dislike about Atriuum ILS?
Most of my concerns about Atriuum would be small feature changes, convenience items, or updates to some features such as the self-checkout module. Most of these items would be things that would make Atriuum work a little better with our library's workflow. As more libraries transition to being fine free, we do feel that some of the management of overdue and lost items could do with updating. We would like for there to be a simpler way for the system to be able to automatically block accounts that have items that were more than a specific number of days overdue. Under the old system with fines it was easy to set fine amount, fine limits and account maximums. As we've done away with the fine portion of the billing process some more/easier options here would be nice. However, Atriuum has been happy to provide some suggestions of ways to make it work for our workflow as best we can, and take enhancement requests for consideration in future updates.

Our library system is new to Atriuum. We went live on 12/1/23. The staff really appreciated the in person training. This training help with transitioning from one ILS to another. Atriuum is easy to use and, as director, I like that the staff have found the transition relatively painless. Our previous system was not the easiest to move over. There were no delays and the system was up and running on time. The public have had nothing but positive comments about the online catalog. Cataloging has also been an easy transition.  Parents and staff like the kids online catalog.

Our library system is part of a consortia, Atriuum has been able to handle our consortia needs easily. There has been some adjustment to the unified catalog that was unexpected but not really an issue. Customer support has been great to work with. They have gotten back to most of our requests within a 24-hour period. Support keeps us informed of the status of the request if it is something that will take time to get an answer.

So far there are very few 'dislikes'. Anything that has come up as a problem, when presented to tech support, we have been satisfied with the answer/solution. Ask us in a year.

We started on Atrium back in 2010. It was an easy transition to download the system. We use this circulation system 7 days a week!  The ease of switching to this system was painless.  One of the best perks was our ability to make patron bar codes along with our own Library cards. We also print own barcodes for item checkouts. And they were always improving the system for example the credit was added to personal accounts, the online card catalog, adding book covers to OPAC, the book bags and patrons able to reserve or renew, able to email notifications and now texting notifications.  They have great Tech Support and the reports are awesome! Atrium is always listening to the customers and continuely add new features.

Our librarians find the report maker somewhat confusing, especially if they are making custom reports. This is important because we like using the numbers in our reports.

Hmmm if I have to choose something, I would say that I wish there were more fields to use when creating a custom report. That's the only thing I've found frustrating at all with the software.

The ability to quickly customize the OPAC display for our students is fantastic. We can arrange blocks of content, create quick book lists and display external links with graphics to support navigation.  I frequently add or change links and lists on the fly while teaching classes.  Atriuum seamlessly integrates with our Sora collection, providing students and teachers with one search query to find print and ebooks.

From the admin side, I can customize an infinite number of reports and overdue notices.  Importing patron records is a breeze; I can even import student pictures easily, which helps at the start of each school year.

The implementation process was painless, and the trainer was patient and professional.  She followed up with additional resources to make sure we were ready to hit the ground running on day one. Any time that I have needed support, the folks on the technical side have quickly answered my questions and solved any issues.

We are thrilled to be saving thousands of dollars compared to our past system, with top-notch customer service, more control of the features, and much better reporting.

What do you dislike about Atriuum ILS?
I'm not sure I would describe this as a downside - but there are so many customizations and controls available on the admin side that it takes some time to learn where everything is in the different menus etc.  Thankfully a quick chat, email or phone call to support results in friendly assistance!

When they updated OPAC, you have a choice between keeping the ""What's coming"", ""What's new"", ""What's hot"" and you can change the background theme.

I am the library supervisor of a very large school district.  We are changing from Destiny to Atriuum.  Our implementation process has been wonderful.  We were assigned an Atriuum implementation team, and everyone has been committed to making this process run smoothly.  We had to make the change from Destiny to Atriuum during the school year, and I was worried that this would be a huge disruption.  Our implementation team worked with me to ensure there were only minimal disruptions to our libraries' day-to-day operations.  Our implementation of Atriuum included two days of professional development for the school media specialists.  This professional development and the trainer were phenomenal.  All the media specialists left the training ready to use Atriuum in their libraries the next day.  Many media specialists said this training was the best professional development they had attended in a long time.  As we have been working in Atriuum for several weeks, we have only encountered a few small issues.  Atriuum tech support has responded to the calls quickly and resolved the issues immediately.  I am incredibly pleased with the implementation process and impressed with how easy Atriuum is for the media specialists and students to use.  Overall, I am thrilled with everything about Atriuum and happy that we made this change.

What do you dislike about Atriuum ILS?
I don't have any dislikes about Atriuum.  If I could change one thing, it would be having Atriuum work as a union catalog.

I like that the Atriuum ILS is simple and easy to use, with all the features and functions we need to run our small library efficiently.  The features that I find easy to use are quick cataloging, Snapshot, the administration panel and how easy it is to integrate other resources into the system, and all of the customizable features to make managing our library processes smooth and trouble-free. Another feature I frequently use is the detailed help guide, and the downloadable materials are a life-saver for those items you don't often do or when new updates are added.

In addition, their customer service is responsive and willing to help with every issue, even just how to line up spine labels to print correctly.  Both Atriuum ILS and its staff have been great resources for our library.

What do you dislike about Atriuum ILS?
Two items (in my opinion) could be improved upon in Atriuum: the OPAC interface and the Watchlist feature. The old OPAC interface needed an update. It was not very user-friendly, had multiple layouts and widgets to choose from and required a lot of time to ensure that the result was what you wanted or expected. This feature was recently updated with a new streamlined OPAC interface option called Gallery, and I am very grateful for the update. The Gallery option is much easier to edit and search for items in the online catalog.

The second item I'm not thrilled with is the watchlist feature. It is a great feature but not as simple as other features. When an item that fits the watchlist terms is added to the catalog, it is not instantly added to reserve lists; the reserve does not show until the following day after the system or server reboots or refreshes. It causes staff confusion about whether the item should be placed on the reserve shelf or displayed. It also keeps new books from being circulated the same day they are processed and ready to go.

What problems is Atriuum ILS solving and how is that benefiting you?

At our school, we use FDS everyday. Students are checking out books and resource items. Library techs and teacher librarians are cataloguing regularly and entering the data into the catalog and searching titles are quite easy.

I can never be 100% certain of how to update the patrons at the beginning of the school year but support line is very helpful and patient with my questions.

We don't use anything other than Titlewave because we use AccessIt.  We feel like AccessIt support is a low priority for Follett.

This is meant for schools and schools are apart of a school district and management across all schools is really cool.

What do you dislike about Follett Destiny Suite?
I HATE that when I am in a site and I go to item status and type in a barcode, it says this device is checked out to another site, would you like to move it here? (NO) I am looking for a device and want to know details.   The OPTIONS should be 1: Do you want to move this device here or 2: Would you like to go view the information on this device at its current site?   I HATE having to hit cancel and then go back and open the site the barcode is located at, do the search again and then get to view the information on the device.  This NEEDS to be corrected, because if I went to the catelog and then tried to do a barcode search, it returns a master record of the barcode, but the barcode is not clickable to enter and view information on it...  In my mind this is simple usability stuff that should have been ironed out a long time ago. I hope your dev team can make this happen.

Great support and a very robust and customizable backend.

What do you dislike about Lyyti?
Making a good looking registration form takes a lot of time, mostly because the original appearance of Lyyti is very old fashioned. The new Lyyti looks way better but is missing a lot of important functions regarding different input types and form input logics. If the customization options available in ""old"" Lyyti merges with the new Lyyti I think that would be great.

The price is often also hard to motivate. I love using Lyyti and the participant management saves me a lot of time, but since the design part takes a lot of time it doesn't always feel like I'm saving enough time that the price is worth it. I wish I did more events so I could justify the price more, but since I am just one person in my company I don't have the capacity to do more events.

Lyyti tarjoaa selkeän työkalun tapahtuman viestinnän ja markkinoinnin tueksi. Helppo viestintä mukaan ilmoittautuneille, entistä paremmat tapahtuman ilmoittautumissivun oheistietomahdollisuudet ja kätevä EVS-palautteen hyödynnysmahdollisuus. Myös tapahtumien kieliversiointi on tehty helpoksi Lyytissä. Asiakaspalvelu toimii erittäin hyvin ja saa nopeasti kiinni avun. Omalle organisaatiolleni myös Salesforce-integraatio on ollut merkittävä asia. Ja uusille tiimiläisille selkeät Lyytin tekemät ohjevideot auttavat pääsemään kärryille Lyytin käytöstä. Lisäksi Lyyti on pääosin hyvin intuitiivinen järjestelmä. Itsellä Lyyti työkaluna päivittäin käytössä töissä, monikielisesti.

What do you dislike about Lyyti?
Osallistujaviestinnässä kääntöpuoli on siinä, että riippuen vastaanottajan sähköpostijärjestelmästä, saattavat viestit päätyä roskapostiin. Eli vaikka varmistat viestin lähteneen asianmukaisesti, ei vastaanottaja aina sitä huomaa. Toisaalta EVS:ssä vielä odotuksessa on se, että saisi itse muokata lähetettyä kysymystä niin, että siihen tulisi lisäinfomahdollisuus. Jotta tukisi paremmin juuri oman organisaation palautteenkeruutarpeita. Ja EVS-naamajärjestelmä on harhaanjohtava prosettien osalta, koska pääosin ihmiset kokevat, että hymytnaamat ovat aina positiivista, mutta järjestäjän suuntaan ns. perus hymynaamaa jos vain annetaan (eikä sitä ""superb""-osaston, jota harva itse asiassa lähtee koskaan antamaan) niin näyttäytyy prosentuaalisesti yllättävänkin heikkona, koska normaali hymynaama lasketaan neutraaliksi, ei positiiviseksi.

DocSend integrates easily with content you may already have on Dropbox that you use in your marketing and business development engagements - and it has APIs to systems like Salesforce and most major email marketing platforms. Customer Support - especially for configuration and onboarding - are top notch, and ensure your team has access to the features they need.  Ongoing usage becomes second nature, with the ability to leverage dashboards to see which prospects are interested in engaging with you and what content they have engaged with. This makes for a better prospect experience, in that outreach is tailored and relevant to the content they have viewed from the documents or spaces you have made available to them. It helps our sales and marketing teams have more meaningful discussions with our prospects and clients, which makes for far more positive discussions for all involved.  We're better engaging prospects on topics of interest, instead of throwing ideas and services against the wall.

What do you dislike about DocSend?
DocSend has few limitations. Dropbox is very responsive to feedback on any issues or ideas (such as how to incorporate mailmerge email links with platforms that aren't in its default list of email platforms that it connects to).

It did the job - I could share links and get signatures. Signing contracts was predictable and relatively easy. The share link worked well and reliably. Pricing was okay too.

What do you dislike about DocSend?
They keep you locked up - there is NO EXPORT for your documents. This is presumably to ensure that it's hard for you to cancel your subscription. That's just bad business practice - they should be retaining me based on value, not on locking up my documents. Plus, this is a business continuity requirement. If I rely on DocSend for all contract retention and there's an issue with the service, I'm out of luck. Yes, I can download each document as it's signed, but that's another step and workflow that should not be required. Then later, I can't be sure that I've downloaded every doc so I need to got 1:1 through DocSend to get the docs. Horrible!

The workflow / UX was not intuitive. Upload gives you multiple options which assume different use cases. The workflow should start with the use case - e.g. sign a contract, share a doc, etc.

What problems is DocSend solving and how is that benefiting you?
Signing documents electronically - saves time and effort and speeds up the contracting process. That's the only reason I use DocSend today. E-signatures are standard in my industry (tech)",1.0,"Name: NOT GIVEN

DocSend provides a secure platform for file sharing and includes many helpful tools for the user. With the ability to create links with different parameters, I'm able to easily share files in different settings. The security measures in place are also great - like making documents invisible over time, or creating custom Spaces and organising them neatly into folders/components with simple drag and drop commands, which saves me so much time! What's more, many document revisions are stored per Space, which is even more convenient when you need it.

What do you dislike about DocSend?
I do not like the fact that previous DocSend connections are still available. This can lead to clutter and make it difficult to quickly navigate or find links between older documents.

ChannelSale is the worst software provider you can find. We signed up with them and then MONTHS went by without anything working. That is not an over-exaggeration... not one single order came through correctly. Pricing was off at every field (total, subtotal, tax) and the order statuses were wrong. They dont do any internal testing when there is a problem, so they use your customers as guinea pigs. They also dont offer refunds - even if the customer had nothing to do with the error. If you are looking at other companies, save yourself time and aggravation by choosing one of them. ANY other company.

Once you figure Sellbrite out, which isn't difficult, listing to multiple selling channels is much less time consuming. Sellbrite integrates with every shopping cart, and selling channel that I've ever thought to use, so it should be an option for most small to medium sized businesses.

What do you dislike about Sellbrite?
Sellbrite is, in my experience, is more like a 90% solution than it is a complete solution for listing products. Maybe that's more a channel specific issue than it is a Sellbrite issue, but I personally still find it necessary to log into my specific selling channels to make product updates that just aren't possible through Sellbrite. Image SEO tags on Shopify are an example, and new products on Amazon would be another, but again, I think these are more limitations of the channels themselves as opposed to something Sellbrite just doesn't do.

Recommendations to others considering Sellbrite:
The best advice I can give you with Sellbrite is when it comes to importing your products, simple is better. I would condense all of my product data into one description field, or utilize the one description field + five features. If you're going to be utilizing any HTML/CSS when pushing product data to something like a Shopify or Big Commerce website, it might be worth your time to simplify that data first, then push the data through a Sellbrite template.

Sellbrite is always there with solutions and problem solving, whenever something comes up. I love the personal attention I receive from this hard working group of people. The order management is seamless and fast to update. Relisting items that have ended on Ebay is simple, and once your systems are in place, it is pretty hard to screw things up.

What do you dislike about Sellbrite?
There are sometimes tiny glitches and minor annoyances within the platform itself, but none of them so far are so problematic that I would consider not using it.  I wish there were ways to populate product variations with parent information, rather than simply copying and pasting. But once you get the hang of it, creating listings is fairly fast. Scrolling around in the listings pages can be a little tricky, as the scrolling bars are off the page and you need to scroll down before you can scroll across. It's as if the Sellbrite screen isn't quite matched perfectly with mine.

The software – GUI is clean, layout is intuitive, interface is snappy and it “works” as expected. These aspects allow me to be more efficient and focus on growing my business. Sellbrite continues to add new sales channels. Sellbrite’s slogan of “simplified multi-channel selling” is spot on.
The support – If something doesn’t work, contact the Sellbrite team and they will investigate. You’ll receive a helpful response typically within 12 business hours. I’ve submitted several feature requests that have been implemented. These factors make me feel like a valued Sellbrite customer.

What do you dislike about Sellbrite?
I’d like to see bookkeeping integration(s) eventually.
There’s currently no “bundling”or ""kitting"" functionality.

I’ve never had security issues, but you can never be too safe anymore. Since Sellbrite is the lifeblood of my business, 2 factor authentication would be nice.

Affordable Multi-Channel Management solution that is easy to navigate and comes with excellent customer service. Provided the necessary tools to allow our business to more than double sales since implementation and we are currently ontrack to triple our sales from 2017 and crush the $1 million mark for the first time in company history.  This could not have happened without an effective multi-channel management tool!

What do you dislike about Sellbrite?
The inability to support bundling and also the inability to create new Amazon products directly from Sellbrite (but this is a high prioirty project that they are working on currently)

Recommendations to others considering Sellbrite:
Be sure to utalize the trial period to get all inventory set up and linked to products.  If the proper set up is not done then Sellbrite cannot do what it was designed to do.

It was somewhat difficult to implement at the beginning.  But, customer service was excellent helping us get it running for us.

What problems is Sellbrite solving and how is that benefiting you?
Shipping is more efficient; comparing the rates of different carriers; using a credit card (with cash back) to pay for USPS shipping labels is nice.

The best part of using Yest is having one central knowledge base containing all the details of one location.  We have used this knowledge to automatically keep our listings up to date on so many websites, but also use it to display location-specific information on our own website, app, and emails.  We take advantage of custom fields to make it house all kinds of information and use the ""labels"" as a great way to keep track of which locations have amenities, are participating in a promotion, etc.  We find ourselves asking other vendors to integrate to our Yext knowledge graph and labels because it is the best single source of truth.   We also find their review response tool easy to use with valuable insights. Although the social posting tool isn't as sophisticated as it could be and doesn't allow for boosting through the tool, it is very handy when pushing content to many child pages.

What do you dislike about Yext?
Yext's support service has decreased drastically in the past few months, possibly due to a decrease in staffing. Our dedicated rep is awesome, but getting anything from engineering or support services is difficult.  We have had trouble with the pages teams in the past-taking a long time to program even if we provide detailed mockups and native files. Just when we found a great pages rep, they got let go. The pervasiveness of our integration makes changing vendors very daunting, so once you start utilizing the knowledge graph everywhere, you're pretty ""stuck"" with it, even if service decreases.

What problems is Yext solving and how is that benefiting you?
Keeping all of the detailed information about all of our locations up-to-date with one central place housing the ultimate source of truth is the biggest problem Yext is solving.

2 - The friendliness and closeness of our rep whenever we need help or set up a call. Yext truly focuses on our issues, and they are always eager to help.
3 - The constant updates to the Knowledge Graph fields. Though many new updates don't quite relate to my line of business, I know Yext is always working on getting these things done. I hope they'll do the same for Google, considering they have been phasing out the Google Business Profiles platform.

What do you dislike about Yext?
1 - The time it takes to update the Knowledge Graph vs. the directories updates. Granted, Google has made several changes to GBPs, but we've been unable to leverage them through the Knowledge Graph. Moreover,
2- I dislike that you can only upload one photo at a time in the Assets library; the only way to do it is to upload the images directly to each store and forgo adding them to the Assets library.
3 - Sometimes, the Support Team doesn't elaborate on why they cannot help you. As the point of contact, I'm not always the most tech-savvy person in the room, so it would be awesome to get a more detailed heads-up on what we can try or research when the Yext Support Team is unable to help.

What do you dislike about Yext?
The Yext API is slow as molasses. We implemented the Yext API to power our Location Finder. With third-party development, we made our tool beautiful, but the API is so slow that it creates a poor user experience. It takes 4-5 seconds to load after the page has loaded, which doesn't seem like a long time, but when you are utilizing the tool for address and contact information that is critical for attracting customers, it really makes a difference. It also creates challenges with Google indexing links that do not exist. Google crawls half-delivered links b/c the slowness of the API, so I have found myself have to fix that on the backend.

Just not as fully functional as Final Draft, again, it’s all about the ease of use.

Recommendations to others considering Movie Magic Screenwriter:
While it’s a solid program and it’s marketed as “a standard in Hollywood”, I just don’t see how that’s possible, Final Draft is THE standard, you can’t reinvent the wheel.

I love the way Movie Magic Screenwriter makes it easy to write the scripts. It basically formats it for you. It is very easy to use and very practical. But my favorite thing is how the software auto completes the words for you. It makes everything so easy and smooth. It cuts around 20% of the time you would spend if you wrote everything yourself. The auto-save feature is awesome as well. When my computer decides to crash, it saves my life.

What do you dislike about Movie Magic Screenwriter?
I don not really like the fact that when you copy and paste the formatting is all wrong, and it really bothers me when I try to edit it, and the program either erases, or writes over what you previously wrote.

Recommendations to others considering Movie Magic Screenwriter:
I would recommend knowing the basics on how to write a screenplay prior to using the program, so you can know the rules and right ways to format everything. I recommend the book that I used in my screenwriting class ""Hollywood Standard: The Complete and Authoritative Guide to Script Format and Style / Edition 2"". It's still very useful nowadays. I get all my formatting questions answered with this book.

Having used Movie Magic Screenwriter in several versions, it wasn't until the NaviDoc that I truly fell in love with the program. Being able to have a quick reference to all my locations and characters makes writing a script that much easier.

What do you dislike about Movie Magic Screenwriter?
I wish that Write Brothers, the publishers of the software, would create a mobile version that would interface with the Desktop version. That said, I have little complaints. I've used at least five different screenwriting programs and, aside from Final Draft, have yet to find one as feature rich and easy to use as this Movie Magic Screenwriter.

Recommendations to others considering Movie Magic Screenwriter:
This is a great program. Honestly, there are only two screenwriting programs that are accepted in the film industry. The de facto standard is Final Draft. Movie Magic Screenwriter holds the number two spot. I think that rationale is a bit unfair, as I prefer it in many respects. Ultimately, I think they are on equal terms and the choice between them is a matter of taste. Some like Final Draft and like it's prestige. Others prefer Movie Magic Screenwriter. I am of the latter variety.

I use it to writer screenplays, teleplays, and scripts for promotional and advertising videos for my video production company.

El Capitan's performance and efficiency stand out as some of its strongest points. The operating system introduces a refined interface that maintains the minimalist Apple design philosophy while incorporating helpful tweaks. The system responsiveness has noticeably improved, resulting in smoother multitasking and faster application launches.

What do you dislike about Apple OS X El Capitan?
Compatibility with Older Hardware: El Capitan's hardware requirements may leave some older Mac devices unable to run the OS smoothly. This can lead to performance issues, slowdowns, and overall frustration for users with aging machines

What problems is Apple OS X El Capitan solving and how is that benefiting you?
Apple OS X El Capitan, released in 2015, was a popular operating system for Mac computers. Users employed it for a variety of purposes:

Productivity and Creativity: Many users utilized El Capitan for tasks like word processing, creating presentations, and graphic design using software like Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Suite, and Apple's own suite of creative applications.

Multimedia: El Capitan provided a platform for multimedia editing, including video and audio editing, making it a choice for professionals and hobbyists in the media and entertainment industry.

Web Browsing and Communication: Everyday tasks like web browsing, emailing, and using various communication apps were common on El Capitan.

Software Development: Developers used El Capitan for software and app development, taking advantage of Xcode, Apple's integrated development environment.

Content Consumption: Users enjoyed media consumption, including streaming videos, listening to music, and reading ebooks, thanks to the system's user-friendly interface and media playback capabilities.

System Stability: El Capitan was praised for its stability and performance improvements over its predecessor, making it a suitable choice for those who valued reliability in their computing environment.

System Maintenance: El Capitan offered tools for system maintenance and troubleshooting, aiding users in keeping their Macs optimized and running smoothly.

Despite its advantages, there were also limitations to El Capitan. It reached its end of life in 2018, meaning it no longer received security updates from Apple. This could pose a security risk, especially for users who continued to use it after its support ended.

Considering its age and lack of updates, if you're looking for an operating system for your Mac, you might want to consider using a more recent version like macOS Big Sur or the latest available version for the best security, compatibility, and features.",2.5,"Name: Valesius K.

The best thing about Apple and its operating system is the quality of its internal products, design, and smooth rendering of applications. There has been quite a lot of optimization from the previous versions.  The experience is seamless, and the shortcuts to apps and toggling have been quite similar to a phone. All the applications that are there inside the OS is completely developed by Apple and are highly used to perform those individual tasks. There is also an activity monitor applicationt which handles the overall tasks performance and cpu usage which can be handled. The trackpad and keyboard shortcuts to the OS are the highlights to the usability.

What do you dislike about Apple OS X El Capitan?
The thing which I dislike the most is the issue with the heating. Even though my OS runs on an Intel chipset,  there could be some software updates that Apple can do to fix it.  The other issue is about the apps like Notes which get hanged and need to be forcefully shut and then have to be reopened. This is a problem that happens when multiple processes are running. Some inbuild apps like Apple Tv and Podcasts are preinstalled and can only be used if paid.

Recommendations to others considering Apple OS X El Capitan:
As an overall thought about Apple OS X, I would recommend that people use this OS. There are more pros than cons. The people who are using OS other than Apple must definitely try this as it brings about a faster, easier and reliable operating system that can be really benificial in a huge way. The amount of workload that was performed in other OS can be scaled down while working in Apple OS. Apple provides in house apps which makes the user experience more satisfying without having to install third party applications. Not every application needs licence and payment.

What problems is Apple OS X El Capitan solving and how is that benefiting you?
The problems of speed, efficiency, accessibility, and reliability are the critical points for using Apple OS X. These qualities are very prominent and firm, not available in other operating systems. Once Apple OS is used, there is never going back. The entire workflow is in the OS is top-notch and saves the user work time in a big way.",4.0,"Name: Vasanth L.

The EI Capitan is much cleaner and neater and easy to work with. All the apps user interface (UI) are attractive too. Not to be mention if you use on a brand new mac machine. I love the new design and layout and how fast it loaded and launched applications. This is what we look for in all operating system (OS) installed on any computer machines, By default, the desktop display is a nice mountain view  with the sun setting shadow over it. Its a perfect view and I lke to see when the computer loads. DId I say also that the computer loads very fast too. It is so much better to have and use. Simple and so user friendly. I can go on and on but apple did a fabolous job in designing and launching this product.

What do you dislike about Apple OS X El Capitan?
There is no negativity about this OS. Apart from the fact that the size of it might be too much but to me it is acceptable. But regardless, it will worth it in my opinion. Remember it is a different platform so it will take sometimes to use to. One thing though, you would need to keep it updated all the time for security reasons. But don't worry about hackers hacking the system since apple engineers are very good to design a very robust system / operation systems. Hackers know this and they stay away from it. BUt hey, that does not mean that it is not possible so it is best to install one of those virus proection software like avast or norton k.

Recommendations to others considering Apple OS X El Capitan:
It will take sometime to use to but that's ok. Take your time and you will get the hand of it. It is worth the effort. Just so you know, most wwindows applications will not work with it so you might have to purchae apple version of the software or use third party. FOr example, get apple microsoft office or use LIbreoffice which is fully integrated with apple mac machine and this opertion system. Apple microsfot office might be expensive but for flawless use it is worth it.  I love it and you know what they say, once you turn to macbook machine and the OS, you can not turn back .

What problems is Apple OS X El Capitan solving and how is that benefiting you?
Just the feel of it and the navigation of it make it so flawless to use and much more easier than a microsoft PC. The benefits I am realizing  is the fast connectivity  and fast loading of the operating system (OS). Before this, we were using microsft PC and it was taking so much to load up. Even opening applications were taking so long to open and work with. It was causing us headaches and frustration with these computers. Apple OS solve these issues and others.

The variety of tools available is totally good. And they are quite, quite good with the restriction of the website. Most of the other tools I have observed let you operate on 4 websites at the same time, some allow 9 websites. But RankActive, they look beyond any aspect and allow 24 websites at a time on the board with 2400 keywords in total. The website digit and keyword limit can only transform it into a valid purchase.

What do you dislike about RankActive?
The subscription I am using is almost perfect. There are some aspects in which SERP values / levels can be accurate, since Google always generates fun effects and is a bit problematic. But what I honestly don't like is that my subscription only leaves the level check when I log in. So, other obligations receive continuous updates, since my subscription has a “check frequency: at the beginning of the session” ability. On the other hand, I got a very cheap offer for life and it is worth much less than a periodic subscription.

I got used to another tool from a few years of use, but I tried out RankActive to accommodate growing needs, and I like it. It does one thing, and it does it very well in an affordable model, far from the rest of the industry.

They give you 2,500 keywords, 25 sites and 5 different engines/locations to check from for each site. And unlike other rank tracking software, these do not count against your 2,500 keywords, so you get what others would count as 10,000 keywords. That could get really expensive elsewhere.

Other tools I like are the No-non-sense keyword research tool, which I found very useful. I also like the way the site auditor works, showing you a detailed list of the pages of your site by problem/alert, rather than just telling you your site have certain problem in X number of pages, or just listing the pages.

What do you dislike about RankActive?
I think what I miss the most is the absence of competitive analysis tools, and the ability to quickly audit sites that are not in your rank tracking list (potential client/competitor scenario). But other than that, it gets the job done.
I have found a small bug in the interface, but it has been fixed since. I also didn't like the icons in the beginning, but that is just a matter of preference.

15442,RankActive,https://www.g2.com/products/rankactive/reviews,2043185,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about RankActive?
Rank Tracking:
Rankactive is generally attractive software - but what makes it a particularly sensible choice is the very low cost for Ranktracking. Many vendors provide daily queries for a variety of popular search engines and do simulate search from most countries / cities in the world. The number of included keywords often at first glance doesn't look bad either - but it's worth checking the details:

The standard billing model in the SEO-software industry does not look at the count of individual keyword but rather counts the number of search queries performed per keyword. If you track the performance of a particular search-term in 5 countries or in 5 different search engines, 5 credits will be required for this one search term alone. The comfortable looking quota of 1000 keywords may in reality shrink down to meager 200 search terms quickly.

RankActive works differently: There is no credit system - for $ 69.95 (on monthly billing) you can really check 2500 keywords daily, with five different search engine configurations. Hence one gets hugely more data for the money, than with all comparable products we have tried.

Cheaper one can only check large amounts of keywords with custom tools and a lot of proxies - not counting  the setup effort. Checking daily rankings with local machines also came at the expense that computers / Internet bandwidth are occupied for likely hours. RankActive goes through search queries in six-digits order within minutes and makes the result conveniently available inside the browser – local hardware remains perfectly idle.


Interface + usability
A big plus point of RankActive is the tidy interface with great-looking graphs and table functionalities, unique in the industry. Some good SEO tools allow users to show and hide and table columns. RankActive goes even one step further by letting  users re-order tables  with drag and drop. It would be nice if typical spreadsheet programs such as Excel or Google Sheets made this so easy. Likewise unique is the facility to display tables tidily grouped by the values ​​in an individual column. Also the interface for data filtering has been solved very well - constantly needed filter functions are reached right from the table header and without modal dialog boxes.

The user interface, programmed in Google's Angular is fully responsive and makes it possible to use all program functions on Desktop machines and Smartphose alike – that still is far from being ubiquitous in 2019.

Onpage analysis:
RankActive comes with a tidy on-page workspace and and already with its ""Optimal"" tarif offers 15,000  crawling depth - per project. If you use the contract to the fullest you may crawl up to 375,000 pages for as often as you like. Onepage tools provided are perfectly adequate for all common analyzes.

Keyword Research:
RankActive has a high performance keyword research workspace and apparently runs a large own index. Within seconds you can read out the complete ranking of competitors and either save as tables or add to the ranking. Also interesting is a sandbox feature that allows you to store keyword candidates within the program without continuously tracking them. It would make sense however,  to save these keywords with all relevant KPIs in that sandbox.

Reporting / Teamwork
We do in-house SEO and therefore have no need for customer-reports. However, this workspace is remarkably complete and versatile and certainly worth a mention. At an extremely low price point SEO agencies may generate reports with their own branding. For daily work with collected data, all tables may get quickly exported standard spreadsheet formats. Also unique in this price range is the generous team-support - already the package for $ 69.95/month lets you add 25 team members and offers a rich set of tools to manage user rights.

What do you dislike about RankActive?
RankActive runs as a Web-Service and not as a Desktop software. While this has the advantage that all the heavy lifting doesn't take place on local machines and that data is available on all operating systems and device types it also suffers from typical disadvantages of services which supply a lot of data via the web: RankActive may be slow at times – and while there's Loader gifs to indicate that the program is still fetching data is not always evident when data delivery has completed. Those who are familiar with their projects can figure out quickly that a certain number is out of expected range and needs updating, but for new or occasional users such may cause a problem. A more rigid system to distinguish old data from data newly served due to custom filtering surely made sense.

Also there's occasional and pretty obscure bugs with data filtering – but I've seen such happening in any comparable tool we used before. Support is very responsive and tries to sort things out, program updates do appear frequently.

While RankActive offers a wide array of valuable tools, one will need other tools, such as Google's Search Console or the free Console Rocket by Linkdex to check Click Impressions, CTR and Clicks. Also there's no more a built in backlink-workspace– RankActive actually had a very nice implementation, which was able to store many backlink-candidates along with quality indicators and contact data. That workspace however worked with third party data and unfortunately got removed, quite recently. There were rumors that the RankActive guys build their own index – so there's room for hope that they'll re-introduce it one day. For the time being one will have to use alternative products for Link-Tracking / building.

What do you dislike about RankActive?
The subscription I am using is mostly flawless. There are a few cases where the SERP values/ranks might not be spot on, since Google always provides dynamic results and is a little finicky.

The map load times are snappy, there are rich customization options and base map choices, their pricing is generous and fair, and their team has been helpful along the way.

It's also easy for our development team to implement features using their APIs and for our integrating partners to use our maps built on Mapbox too.

The geocoding API is not always as accurate as others, such as Google's. It occasionally returns results that are not what the user would expect and doesn't have as many location names, such as small villages.

15470,Mapbox,https://www.g2.com/products/mapbox/reviews,8771861,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about Mapbox?
Mapbox's mapping tools are Best in Class at the moment, if you are serious about making powerful, beautiful, configurable maps that load quickly and look great. They have more options than anyone else out there, and actually seem to care about innovating in the mapping space (unlike Google Maps, which has been practically dormant for a long time now). Their Mapbox Studio tool makes it effortless to change the appearance of map features, and their satellite tiles are beautiful and in high definition. Mapbox has been on the cutting edge of vector-based mapping technology, which is rapidly becoming the standard for good reason.

Beyond this, their Community & Social outreach has been execllent. I have been a heavy user of Mapbox maps since 2018. I run a popular website (NUKEMAP, a nuclear weapons effects simulator) that can have extremely variable traffic spikes depending on world events and media coverage, and is also entirely not-for-profit (with no advertising, etc.) and run on a shoestring budget. I switched to Mapbox from Google Maps because it became clear that Google was too interested in monetizing their interactions with people like me to be usable, and their prices were killing any ability to have a widely-used website that was not focused around generating profit. Mapbox has been willing to work with me, and has worked to find plans that would fit my budget, given the nature of the work, and has given me huge amounts of assistance and patience when I have been in between sponsors.

What do you dislike about Mapbox?
The only issue I have had with Mapbox is that their out-of-the-box API tools are not particularly suited to the kinds of operations that one might want to do, like drawing dynamic vector circles in my case. However their API is very flexible and with a little elbow-grease, you can make it do whatever you want, and it runs extremely fast no matter what. So while it might take a little more effort to get things up and running, once you have them up and running it will look good, and run fast.

What problems is Mapbox solving and how is that benefiting you?
I use Mapbox to visualize spatial data, specifically to show people what the effects of nuclear weapons would be on areas they have been to. To do this, I am using their vector tile service, their satellite tiles, and their raster tiles as a fallback option for users without WebGL (which for a global app is still quite a lot). Since 2018, when I switched to Mapbox, NUKEMAP has had over 40 million users globally, including massive traffic spikes whenever world events have caused people to seek out information about nuclear weapons (e.g., between February and June 2022 saw nearly 9 million users as tensions between NATO and Russia increased following the Russian invasion of Ukraine). Being able to provide this kind of factual information in an intuitive and good-looking map interface is core to my educational mission, and Mapbox's tools have made this possible.",5.0,"Name: Alex W.

What I love about Mapbox is the amount of features they provide. Mapbox Studio is just an incredible tool. As Mapbox' ecosystem allows you to upload your own data, the possibilities are just infinite!

In my specific case, I had to integrate Mapbox in a React application, and the documentation for doing it was quite extensive and detailed. I had never integrated a map-related tool before, and it has been really easy to find all solutions to the problems I have had.

What do you dislike about Mapbox?
The main thing I do not like about Mapbox is related to their satellite imagery. A lot of regions have not been updated for too many years. And with too many years I mean that even the 'shape' of the agricultural fields has changed and does not correspond to reality anymore. Plus, in some areas clouds cover thousands of square kilometers (e.g., east coast of Brazil). Both reasons obliged us to look for other satellite imagery, so we could still load it within Mapbox GL library.

Point of Interests is very helpful, because we can use our data and prefabs to render certain data visualization. For example, we used our tree data set and used Point of Interests to show the trees in New York. We made our prefab of the trees and it was pretty great result.
The integration with AR Core and AR Kit makes it easy to use as AR product

What do you dislike about Mapbox?
The documentation is handy and user friendly but there is not enough official tutorials, and there is no API references of the sdk. The most tutorial I learned was from Youtube tutorials. Also, when adjusting the zoom level, the buildings lost is not satisfying. When you set the zoom level to some certain level, part of the buildings are just disappear. This may because to keep the frames when running so that it's not too heavy for the device to render so many buildings, but the lost buildings are too many and not expected. Besides, when adding multiple maps, it is still heavy to load. Maybe there is some way to reduce the cost like optimize the shader and reduce the mesh of the buildings.

Recommendations to others considering Mapbox:
Mapbox is a great tool for making geographical or geological products including AR, Games and data visualization

What problems is Mapbox solving and how is that benefiting you?
We were building a AR urban data visualization by using Mapbox. Mapbox has a great default building dataset, and we can also use our data and customize the shader on the buildings. It is integrated with AR Core and AR Kit, so no need to worry about those.",5.0,"Name: NOT GIVEN

It was easy to set up, but we find this to be the case with any JavaScript based mapping solution

What do you dislike about Mapbox?
We have used Map box for over one year. We are a large software company and pay a significant amount of money to use this every month. They have contacted us about a price increase. I contacted their sales to establish what the new price would be. They reassured me that the price would drop for 3/4 customers but, when pressed further, then went on to tell me “I cannot tell you what your new price will be exactly.” We believe that this sales strategy to be fundamentally misleading. Our best guess is that the cost will increase by a factor of 10.

We started to use VIPole instead of Skype, because it offered similar functionality, topped by end-to-end encryption. Apart from chatting, the app has a number of features for managing productivity, including a simple task manager, and the team releases updates monthly. I especially appreciate that it is easy to find the files that we’ve shared months ago and to forward them to other chats. I also use VIPole to manage passwords from a number of online services, for some of them, the access is shared within our team. In VIPole, passwords are stored encrypted and are easy to reach in both mobile and desktop VIPole apps.

What do you dislike about VIPole?
There are so many options in the app, that sometimes we discover we could do the things that we never previously considered an option. Especially when it comes to security configurations. However, from the first look, they are completely unrecognizable, and VIPole does not push you in any way to try these settings.

16437,DataFox,https://www.g2.com/products/datafox/reviews,795254,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about DataFox?
I like that DataFox enables you to set a wide variety of filters when you search for companies to prospect. Just to name some of these filters to give you an idea of the level of detail, you can search by industry keywords, headcount / size of company, location, revenue, job postings, conferences they're attending, when the company was founded, and my personal favorite is that you can search for companies that are or are not currently in your company's salesforce.

What do you dislike about DataFox?
I dislike that the tool populates companies that are outside of your filters. For example, I work for a software company and I am an Account Manager and we sell our software to other software companies. When I want to look up software companies in a certain space, like Accounting Software for example, I set that filter. What I've found however is that a lot of the companies that are populated are involved in Accounting, but are not software. The difficulty this presents is that I have to pick through the list before I start prospecting, otherwise I will waste time/resources on companies that are not even within my search criteria.

Recommendations to others considering DataFox:
Datafox is a solid tool when it comes to assisting you in finding companies to prospect. It's a lot better than trying to piece together prospecting lists with Google. That being said, be prepared for some inaccuracy in the company searches you do.

What problems is DataFox solving and how is that benefiting you?
Without Datafox, we would have to use basic google searches to find different software in different spaces like event management, cyber security, accounting software, etc. Then we would need to manually enter these companies into a sheet so that we can import them into salesforce. Datafox comes in and cuts out a lot of the manual labor there. It populates large lists of companies, and though sometimes the lists are mildly inaccurate to the filters, it is still very helpful.",3.5,"Name: Shane F.

Some features are up to par comparatively.  Otherwise, nothing stands out to me that I would rave about.

What do you dislike about Applied Epic?
The software is slow, archaic, inefficient, expensive, and hard to visibly see.  It's like a mixture of an IRS tax form and Windows 8.  Its navigation for anything requires you to take a 5-minute training.  Processes a click path jungle. Real customization is only allowed if it's released as a feature that requires you to post about it and get thousands of upvotes.  Their dev ops team is a small group of overworked coders.

If a few features were implemented, graphics would be updated to the personalization of the agent and better data transfer capabilities.  I could vouch for EPIC.  But if we compare the cost of goods to other software, EPIC is a massive over-marketed and overvalued product in my opinion.  If you have to code to create a simple report or proposal... you get the idea...

What do you dislike about Applied Epic?
I don't like how difficult it is to find out who a producer or CSR is for an account. TAM showed this information on the search screen, in Epic it takes searching for the client, opening the account on the detail page and clicking a tab. I don't like that a producer can't be added after a transaction has been finished, it has to be backed out and redone. This should pull automatically from the account details but it doesn't always, if the CSR is not paying full attention it gets missed and it is a pain to fix. CSRs are very busy and sometimes they get in too big of a hurry and it gets missed. It just adds more work to them when it needs fixed. I should be able to go in and edit the producer if needed.

It looks new/modern, activity use is okay from the home screen, and the compliance aspect of it helps keep accounts accurate and current.

What do you dislike about Applied Epic?
EPIC is clearly a system designed and programmed by individuals who do not have to use its functionality to service insurance accounts on a daily basis, nor does it reflect that research or dedication has been put in place to make sure it meets those standards. The promises and implementation of the program were severely lacking and did not deliver on the expectations across our agency. Coming from a much older system, it is disappointing to have less convenient features that are used to help us work efficiently, especially by a system that is so widely used. We have several issues regarding the ease of use, including the following:

- frequent crashes or bugs in the system that render it unusable for a period of time. This is a near-daily occurrence.
- preview, print, or other actions that simply don't pop up or go through once clicked
- COI functionality is abysmal, both in EPIC and CSR24. Our agency has been on the system for 5 months and has yet to decide which interface we can tolerate more in order to issue COIs. Neither is a good option on its own.
- Emails when dragged and dropped do not pull in attachments that were in the email. This severely slows down our data entry processing time
- Sometimes, the system won't even let us drag and drop emails at all
- Email attachment is not automatic. Our last system had integration that would allow us to attach emails that originated out of the system. So far, EPIC only attaches the email if the email address was clicked from the system, and even then, the connection suite frequently gets disabled or inactivated for various reasons which means we still have to manually attach the correspondence - this is a HUGE time suck for us.
- No availability to use a ""dec page"" function that gives agents a quick overview of the coverages on a policy. Our old system had this at the click of a button and it is a massive boon to how quickly we were able to verify coverage for any number of reasons
- the system is SLOW. Processing time to open accounts, policies, attachments, etc can take a long time and slows down our workflow
- Logical connection between what a function should do, what it is supposed to do, and how to get to the area to make it do that is very difficult for new users to understand. The training videos, help manuals, and the implementation team did not make using the system easier. Even the User Manual alone leaves out vital information. We need to know what specifically to click to process transactions, not what we need to type in an activity. Tell us what the buttons do and how to navigate the program, not how to work with our accounts.
- why can tasks not be edited with a right click? you have to go into the task itself to change anything about it. This means more clicks and more time on our part.
-Why does the account name not appear anywhere except in the right-hand corner? Even then, it is only the primary contact. As a commercial lines account manager, I don't know the name of my contact for every business, and the bottom left tab minimizes itself frequently as well. The name should at least stay above ""account detail"" or somewhere the user can see it at a glance. The name appearing in the tab is negligible as well because often we have too many tabs open to see the name.

The expectations of our agency transitioning to this new system were that it would be faster, more modern, and more automated which meant less time for Account managers to spend on documentation and record keeping. So far, the limitations of the system have only added to the time it takes for us to make sure our accounts are documented properly and up to date. It also takes up a huge amount of time to try to find coverages while on the phone with our client, and several of us default to going outside of the system to the carrier's website to pull that information. The ease of readily available information for an account is something that we are struggling to find within EPIC and it has been a significant source of frustration.

I like that the system is very user friendly and easy to understand after a short learning curve.

What do you dislike about RISKMASTER?
From a finance perspective, I dislike that the software does not allow exporting data to csv or excel in certain places like the funds management for individual claims. It would be very helpful to be able to export large portions of data from individual claims or from whole programs so that we could analyze the data more effectively.

It is also difficult to navigate from an individual payment (in our case, a check) to the claim that is associated with that payment. If the claim could be accessed in a one-click fashion, it would make the processing much smoother.

Setting up logstash took a while when I had no idea how to get it working. What I am trying to say is the learning curve was a little higher than I thought. That and GROK is horrible.

Recommendations to others considering Elastic Security:
Learn to use Grok. Find a Grok parser online and then look for a LOT of guides on how to write grok.  There are plenty of them out there.

When you have found your guide, test out your code. Set up a CI / CD environment, even if it is a simple one to test out your changes to your logstash configuration files.

Make sure you setup all your inputs and outputs as separate files, it makes for a LOT easier debugs.
Use a version control system like git, it makes finding problems with  your configuration changes a LOT easier

Basically what I am saying is follow the principals of DevOps, logstash is trouble

18693,Dubber,https://www.g2.com/products/dubber/reviews,4698705,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about Dubber?
I really do like Dubber and am glad we have it. We use Cox Communications for 3 main call centers with over 70 agents in all. For the longest time Cox didn't have anything to record calls so they partnered with Dubber to offer that service. I like that I can export the calls to a file or email a link. The search is fast with various filters and I can break up the agetns into teams so that certain supervisors can only listen to certain agents. I like that it shows the length of the calls and callerID. I can scrub through the audio right on the website.

What do you dislike about Dubber?
It can't automatically sync up with Cox, so if a first/last name in Cox changes, I have to manually change it in Dubber to match up. Fortunately, they do make it easy to see the ones that don't sync up. They list them on a page for you to review. Though they could make it even easier if we could click a button on that page to update Dubber with Cox's first/last name instantly, instead of requiring me to go to each of the out-of-sync phones one-by-one to change the first/last names manually in Dubber.

A limitation that they've put in to speed things up is that you can only scroll through so many pages of calls before you hit a wall. To get past this, you have to put a filter in for a date range or agent, since it has a finite amount of pages you can scroll through. In most cases, this isn't a problem, but our agents take hundreds of calls a day, so you really do need to put those filters in or you'll hit that wall.

On the setup page to order/sync between Cox and Dubber, there is no search feature, so I have to scroll through 400 names/numbers to find the phone I want to add to Dubber. I find myself just using the browser's search feature and guessing which page it might be on. Smaller customers won't find this as cumbersome as us.

Also, Dubber's system has bug where if two phones have the same first/last name and one of the phones is out of sync (which happens when an agent moves to a different phone) AND you change the plan type of one of the phones. Dubber's system will link (merge) the accounts, so then I have to delete both accounts and recreate them, since they can't be unlinked. That's a rare bug and all 3 conditions have to be met for it to happen. I'm guessing most people won't ever experience this but it's happened 3 times to me over the past couple years.

Recommendations to others considering Dubber:
For Cox business customers, there is no alternative, but even if there were, I'd still feel comfortable using Dubber. I haven't used the analytics feature, but I think that sounds really cool. Recording calls for any system is not cheap, but it's worth it for us. There's a different pricing structure for call centers, so make sure you get the correct package. Getting it tied to Cox was surprisingly fast. Cox and Dubber were essentially able to click a button and turn it on. Then I just had to go through all the phones I wanted to record and pick a plan for each, based on the call volume I expected each phone to have. It does record inbound and outbound calls (internal and external), regardless if the call came in from the call center queues, so keep that in mind. The one thing it doesn't have is a reporting system to tally up all your minutes for each phone each month, so if you go over your limit you don't exactly know which phone was the culprit. I'm sure if I put a ticket in they'd let me know. Their helpdesk is eager to help.

What problems is Dubber solving and how is that benefiting you?
We can now better train and give feedback to agents and do some quality control. It helps with disputes and finally gives us the true story of what really happened. An unexpected benifit is that I have also been able to coorelate the voice recordings with the raww call logs from Cox, which has helped fill in the gaps.",5.0,"Name: Matt P.

20191,Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS),https://www.g2.com/products/amazon-elastic-file-system-amazon-efs/reviews,8197502,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)?
Scalability: Automatically scales storage capacity to meet your needs.
Elasticity: Adjusts file system size dynamically as you add or remove files.
Performance: Provides low-latency access and high throughput for applications.
Durability and Availability: Replicates data across multiple Availability Zones for high data durability and availability.
Integration: Seamlessly integrates with other AWS services for easy data sharing and collaboration.
Security: Offers encryption at rest and in transit, and allows access control management.
Cost-Effective: Pay-as-you-go pricing with no upfront costs or minimum commitments.
These advantages make Amazon EFS a flexible, reliable, and cost-efficient solution for file storage in the cloud.

What do you dislike about Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)?
Performance Limitations: While Amazon EFS provides good performance, it may not be suitable for applications with extremely high-performance requirements or intensive workloads.
Cost: Although Amazon EFS offers cost-effective pricing, it can be more expensive compared to other storage options, especially for high-throughput or high-capacity workloads.
Latency: The network-based nature of Amazon EFS can introduce some latency compared to local file systems, which might impact certain latency-sensitive applications.
Throughput Scaling: While EFS can scale its storage capacity, scaling throughput can be challenging and might require additional configuration or provisioned throughput modes.
Limited Access Control: The access control mechanisms of Amazon EFS are limited compared to other file systems, and fine-grained permission management may require additional configuration or third-party solutions.
Regional Limitation: Amazon EFS is limited to specific AWS regions, so it may not be available in all regions where AWS services are offered.
Performance Variability: Performance of Amazon EFS can vary based on the file system size, number of concurrent clients, and data access patterns, which may require careful monitoring and optimization.

What problems is Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) solving and how is that benefiting you?
As Amazon EFS charges based on the amount of storage used, organizations may find it challenging to predict and control their expenses, especially if the storage usage fluctuates significantly.

Solution: To mitigate the issue of unexpected costs with Amazon EFS, organizations can implement the following strategies:

Monitor and Optimize Usage: Regularly monitor the storage usage of the Amazon EFS file system to identify any unexpected spikes or abnormal patterns. By understanding the usage trends, organizations can optimize their storage consumption, identify any inefficiencies, and take appropriate actions to minimize costs.
Use Lifecycle Management: Amazon EFS provides a lifecycle management feature that allows organizations to automatically transition files to lower-cost storage classes based on usage patterns. By utilizing this feature, less frequently accessed or older data can be moved to cheaper storage tiers, reducing overall costs while still ensuring data availability.
Set Alarms and Notifications: Configure cost-related alarms and notifications through AWS CloudWatch to proactively alert stakeholders when storage costs exceed predefined thresholds. This helps organizations stay informed about their spending and take timely actions to optimize usage or adjust their storage requirements.
Leverage Provisioned Throughput: For workloads with consistent and predictable performance requirements, consider using the provisioned throughput mode instead of the default burst mode. Provisioned throughput allows organizations to provision a specific level of performance for their file system, ensuring predictable performance while managing costs effectively.
Opt for Cost Analysis Tools: Utilize cost analysis tools available in AWS, such as AWS Cost Explorer, to gain deeper insights into your Amazon EFS spending. These tools can provide detailed breakdowns of costs, allowing you to analyze usage patterns, identify cost drivers, and optimize your storage utilization further.
By implementing these solutions, organizations can proactively manage and control costs associated with Amazon EFS, ensuring that storage expenses remain within budget and aligned with their business needs.",3.5,"Name: NOT GIVEN

We thought that this was going to be a great platform. Easy to use and all the right features. That is the case BUT....it is impossible to do smooth transitions between recorded shows. I have spent a year communicating with them and trying work arounds. The only one that would work would involve every show being 1 hour and 20 seconds long so putting the whole schedule another 20 seconds behind after each show. Their reaction is this.........I appreciate this is frustrating, but as Pete mentioned, the above workaround is the best way at this current time.I am sorry for that, but it's something we can look in to as part of our future product improvements.

20657,Radio.co,https://www.g2.com/products/radio-co/reviews,4873242,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about Radio.co?
1)	Everything is literally easy to use, from scheduling right through to music database management. The UI is visually great & clear so there’s no clutter or anything else that could potentially hamper your workflow about accessing whatever you want to use.

2)	No extra pieces of broadcasting software are needed. Everything is practically in one place.

3)	Compatible with a majority of audio equipment to get broadcasting within minutes.

4)	Ease of access from devices such as smartphones or tablets so you can continue your work on the go or check to see if everything’s running ok. And as long as you have a stable internet connection, you can literally broadcast from anywhere. Super handy if you were to report on events or do a live show at a festival right through to interviewing guests elsewhere if they’re unable to come to you. In that case, trust us, get yourself a Rodecaster Pro as well to compliment Radio.co with your radio setup, especially because it’s a very versatile & powerful piece of audio equipment that’s portable enough that you can take it on the go with you to those kinds of events & interviews. Sure, it’s expensive but you’ll thank yourself for investing in a piece of kit you can have around for years since RODE aren’t releasing a follow up to the Rodecaster Pro anytime soon, even though it was released in December 2018 & there have been major beneficial updates to it in terms of firmware over the years. Plus, radio stations & enthusiasts are still buying these because of how popular it is with nothing else coming close to how good it is to use & the top-quality audio you get from it.

5)	The platform provides very useful & understandable analytical data to judge station performance. Especially a very handy automated report for this as well that gets emailed to you on a weekly basis so that you can see where the peak listenerships are & take advantage to drive up more listeners with more content that seems to be going down well with the audience at those popular times on whatever day of the week.

6)	Radio.co’s support team are always helpful & knowledgeable, especially from our personal experience so far. The individuals that you’ll likely be speaking with on a regular basis for issues or just any questions you may have about the platform itself are honestly polite & respectful. There were a few occasions during the year since we joined up where we ran into some issues, but nothing major that has impacted our experience of using the platform. There were also delays in getting a response sometimes, but obviously, it was understandably due to Covid. Things have gotten better with this, particularly since Covid restrictions have eased & it feels like the support team are more available.

7)	Pricing plan is decent & still relatively inexpensive, plus there’s room for negotiating & flexibility in terms of how much bandwidth, listener stream numbers, storage, etc that your station will need, especially in the beginning. You got the convenient option to temporarily freeze your account for a set period of time if you’re unable to carry on broadcasting due to financial restraints & then pick things back up where you left off once you feel that you’re able to carry on broadcasting your station again. However, you have to resume your account to keep all the hard work you’ve done within the set freeze period, your station gets removed after that & you’ll, unfortunately, have to re-apply again.

8)	The stream quality is great & you can very easily embed your online player anywhere or share to social media platforms where the station’s & the presenter’s followers can quickly access to tune into your stream. You can even design your own schedule widget to embed on your station’s website which is super handy if people want to check over the span of 2 weeks what’s available to listen into.

9)	Web building is through Weebly, which is attached to the platform’s dashboard to access and is very easy to use to set up your own webpage for your station in no time at all. Same for the app builder for Android & iOS. There’s plenty of tutorials on how to get started & how to use the creative tools to design something that fits with your radio brand’s image, colours, etc. (if you’re going for the app builder feature, you must sign up to a Google & Apple developer account. But don’t worry though, because it’s easy to understand with step-by-step instructions given to you on how to get your app on the respective store platforms via an automated email by the Radio.co team once your app passes the developer review phase)

10)	This isn’t platform related, but it’s worth pointing out that if you do run into some issues during your experience with the platform, then visit their YouTube channel, which has a variety of videos that range from software compatibility problem-solving, educational & training tips for presenters, help & advice on how to make your station a success as well as very handy reviews of broadcasting related equipment on a regular basis. It even has video contributions from the founder of Radio.co – James Mulvany, which are useful & a worthwhile watch as well.

11)	The great thing about it as well is that it’s presenter friendly which makes it easy for them to understand & jump on to broadcast their show in minutes. The main dashboard that they can see even gives a countdown timer on the day that they’re going to broadcast their shows & tells them how long they got until they go live.

12)	Presenter Show Promos get shown up in a very neat way via the metadata on the online player as well as the apps so that the listeners can know who they’re tuning into at any time of the day. Plus, this helps to further promote your talent, which they’ll appreciate.

13)	There’s a lot of creativity to be had on the platform, which is pretty amazing & blew us away with how much we can get done in no time at all, simply because of how easy they have made everything to use. It genuinely feels like we could spend hours on it, and one of the best features is that if you’re away doing whatever & you leave it idle on any part of the dashboard, it’ll actually pause it so that you save bandwidth usage. Big props to Radio.co for implementing something that might be considered minor, but really smart though. More stuff like this please!

What do you dislike about Radio.co?
1)	Dark mode would be a nice welcome edition, especially if you’re managing a busy station which practically needs to be handled mostly around the clock, so having this as an option to select in the settings as a theme changer would lessen the strain on the eyes in the evening time when we particularly do music database management, scheduling changes, uploading pre-recorded shows, etc.

2)	The metadata can sometimes be hit or miss, but in our experience, it’s been thankfully more hit than miss. Radio.co are working hard on a solution to fix this since a small number of stations including ours have been affected. (we’ll re-edit this part of the review to reflect when that solution is eventually implemented) It’s basically when the presenter’s promo show picture doesn’t get displayed when that show has connected to the station & still displaying the previous show’s picture metadata. The feedback we brought to Radio.co about this is have the live show that connects next on the schedule to always take priority even if the previous live show finishes over their set programming time. This way, it entirely avoids having to reset your station off & back on-air again to get the next metadata to show up correctly especially because it’ll affect what’s displayed in the apps too. But in that space of time when you’ve done that, you could potentially have lost listeners or have an annoyed presenter to deal with when you shouldn’t have to which can lead to losing talent because they’re relying on you to fix these minor issues. The solution we have on our station for the moment while Radio.co are trying to fix this metadata issue, is by telling our presenters to finish their shows before the next hour begins. This depends on how long of a show your own presenters are doing but ours do 2hr show slots & are required to finish between 1hr 59mins to just before the next hour begins so that the metadata has enough time to change over to the next show’s promo picture when the that presenter connects to the station at their scheduled programming time.

3)	This is more of a “what we want to see added that would be really cool to have” sort of thing & that’s having a Tweet Deck style social media posting suite which would be extremely convenient to have since it’ll negate having to sign up to anywhere else that provides that service or having to laboriously do it yourself on the presenter’s behalf if they don’t have access to the station’s social accounts to do it themselves. Having a dedicated suite for this would alleviate so much grind because if you’re already working on the dashboard then it’s handy to have something like that in the same place rather than having to switch over to another tab where your Tweet Deck work is. One less tab open, means less tab clutter, especially if you’re trying to work in a very efficient way to get posts out on time.

4)	Again, this is more of a “what we want to see added that would be really cool to have” sort of thing & that’s a Myriad style playout suite where you can essentially broadcast from the dashboard instead of having to use other play out style software such as Virtual DJ or whatever else. The dashboard already gives an option to build playlists so why not go the extra mile so to speak & add in a proper broadcasting section akin to Myriad? It could be possible that Radio.co are working on something similar that they can implement as their own special something that’s not too far removed from what people have used elsewhere in terms of playout software brands. Put it this way, it would be an ultimate all-in-one package where you have just one place to go for practically everything.

5)	Some sort of proper ducking feature would be nice since it doesn’t seem to work even when you use a music play-out software like Virtual DJ. It should automatically duck when a presenter talks, but the talk still gets drowned out by the music even though the setting for ducking is set originally to 80%. We’re getting around this by doing it the classic manual way on our Rodecaster Pro. It’s not a huge gripe but could be looked at as something to improve so that it can smartly recognize when a presenter’s talking while another audio channel is active despite whatever music playout software from your PC/laptop that you’re using.

6)	It would be cool to see a visual roadmap of the upcoming developments & improvements of the platform just so it gives clients like us an outlook of features that could be coming as something to look forward to or even plan ahead for that can impact your station in a positive way.

7)	You have to get used to talking with Radio.co’s support team via their online chat & through emails. There’s no number to call despite the fact that it’s always nice to actually speak to someone regarding issues. But again, it’s not huge a gripe because we understand why they want to have things like this because it avoids a needless call centre type of system so that they can spend their time more productively on improving every facet of the platform. And besides, while you’re waiting on them to reply back, you can just get on with your work in the meantime & that’s what we do, which isn’t a problem for us.

Recommendations to others considering Radio.co:
We’ve been with Radio.co for just over a year now & we’ve left a review to this point on purpose because, firstly, we genuinely have enjoyed using this cloud-based service platform. And secondly, we wanted to properly experience all facets of it so that if anyone else that’s sitting on the fence waiting to decide before committing or simply wants to join but needs to research to see if Radio.co is a right fit for them, then at least our comprehensive in-depth experience will give them a better understanding of what it’s honestly like to use & be a client of on this type of broadcasting brand.

Let’s get one thing out of the way first – Radio.co is a very good option to consider but isn’t a cheap one. Especially because you’re only going to get the most out of it by having the pro-level features. This really caters for someone or a team that are hugely passionate about everything to do with Radio & are also ambitious enough to put in enough hard work so that their station will eventually become a self-sustainable business that they can recoup back what they pay out in expenses to use this cloud-based service. Besides, this platform is capable & powerful enough to fulfil that kind of need & encourage those kinds of highly motivated & driven individuals or teams to go onto succeed enough that they can potentially compete or offer something genuinely different to what’s already available out there even on regional & national level.

Radio.co is also really ideal for educational institutions & youth-based organizations that are comfortably funded enough that they won’t have trouble getting a source of income to keep their radio project going. That’s why it’s perfect for student radio type development, where candidates are going to start off as newcomers to the world of Radio as well as gaining useful transferable skills that they can take into other media-based industries after they graduate.

What problems is Radio.co solving and how is that benefiting you?
Apart from that, there’s nothing else that we can point out as a negative or a frustrating annoyance. The team behind Radio.co have truly built something special & we’re glad to be here at the right moment since launching the station in November 2020. It’s the best place to be & it’s really enjoyable to use the platform from our perspective. Hence why we’ve given it a fair 4/5 rating (4.5 if we could, but Trustpilot doesn’t do half incremental on their ratings) because it’s not totally perfect, but then again, what cloud-based service is? As long as 9/10 things work on a regular basis then it’s nothing to grumble about since the minor things don’t have any impact on the overall experience. We’re just thankful that we’ve only ever had a small handful of incidents, but they’ve been rectified by the support team relatively within the same conversation when you bring up those issues with them.

Besides, if you’re looking for the best all-round package for all your radio broadcasting needs, then we highly recommend Radio.co. Again, it’s not the cheapest option since you need to pay for the premium level pro features to get the most out of it because on the basic plan, you may feel it will end up feeling restrictive. The extra features are worth paying that bit extra for, which can benefit your station. For us personally, having our own app was essential in tapping into a wide-ranging audience that carry around portable devices like smartphones, tablets, etc. Online stations rely & thrive through those types of devices that everyone carries on them as an essential & important item. Therefore, if that kind of reliance is anything to go by, then the digital platform is only going to continue to grow & offer far more alternative variety over traditional FM/AM/DAB stations simply because online radio is surprisingly a convenient place for people to access easily as well since it can cater better towards their taste in music.",4.5,"Name: Abid H.

Microsoft teams is a online video conferencing app which has many features that make it one of the best in the segment. Microsoft Teams is a software which provides video conferencing , chat, file sharing and collaboration in a single platform.

It is a product of Microsoft so it is easier to integrate with other Microsoft 365 apps like outlook, drive, etc.
It provides video and audio conferencing features which allows users to schedule and join meetings anywhere, anytime provided they have a internet connection.
Microsoft teams provides various customization options to cater the needs of all type of organizations and users. Users can customize tabs, themes, background etc.

It's easy to use and beginner friendly as new user can easliy learn to implement it in daily use.
Being a product of Microsoft it's customer support is above par and is very good.

I personally use microsoft teams almost daily for seminars, webinars, online lectures etc. And i have found no problem in using it personally.

What do you dislike about Microsoft Teams?
One of the feature i dislike most is the limit on the storage for sharing file and collaborations when we are using free plans, if organization have large data to handle then they have to buy paid plans.

It is a cloud based service so it relies heavily on stable internet connection, if our connection has disruptions or is irregular then it can hinder communicaton process.

While microsoft teams integrates easily with microsoft apps , same it finds very difficult to integrate with non microsoft softwares.It has limited compatibility with other services.

Next thing which found very annoying is it's large amount of notification it generate and somtimes it has performance issues like glitches or loading time increases.

What problems is Microsoft Teams solving and how is that benefiting you?
I'm an student and a freelancer so i have to deal with large number of clients or people online. So Microsoft Teams provide a seamless way to connect with those people online without any disruptions.  Many of my classes are also conducted online so it is easier to take them on Teams due to it's large capacity to hold the traffic and manage them without overloading.

Microsoft teams provide features to conduct meetings online which saves travelling time , it has features to share screen or present screen which comes very handy during presentation of slides to the customers or clients.
It has many features  like video conferencing, chat, file sharing , screen sharing, collaborations which is good package as it solves all the problem of meetings and classes.

If I had to choose what I like best about Microsoft Teams, I would say it's the seamless integration with other Microsoft 365 apps. The ability to co-author documents in real-time with teammates while easily sharing files, collaborating on projects through shared workspaces, and communicating via chat or video calls, all within a single interface is incredibly valuable. This tight integration streamlines workflows and enhances team productivity significantly. Teams essentially acts as a central hub that brings together all the key tools teams need to collaborate effectively in today's digital workplace.

What do you dislike about Microsoft Teams?
With so many features and integrations packed into one platform, the interface can feel busy and difficult to navigate at times. The constant barrage of notifications from chats, file shares, @mentions, etc. can also become distracting and reduce productivity if not properly managed. Another potential downside is the steep learning curve, especially for users who are new to Microsoft's ecosystem of apps and services. Mastering all the capabilities of Teams and understanding how to integrate it with other M365 apps can take some time and training

What problems is Microsoft Teams solving and how is that benefiting you?
Microsoft Teams solves challenges of fragmented tools, remote collaboration hurdles, and document collaboration inefficiencies. By unifying communication, file-sharing, video conferencing, and Office app integration into one hub, Teams boosts productivity, enhances organization, enables seamless co-authoring, and fosters better team alignment regardless of members' locations.

We are a team that went fully remote in March of 2020, and following the pandemic, we decided to stay fully remote. We use Microsoft Teams on a daily basis to keep our team in the loop about updates, communicate across departments, run polls, share files, and communicate our availability. I'm not sure how we functioned prior to using Microsoft Teams.

What do you dislike about Microsoft Teams?
As is the case with all of the Microsoft suite, when there are updates/bugs that are occuring, it impacts several facets of the suite of products. Teams recently did an update, and it created issues throughout our organization for the next 1-2 weeks that followed.

Aside of that, I wish there was a way to pin more than one message in a group chat. We currently are only able to pin one message per Teams chat, and that makes it hard when we have multiple announcements that we want highlighted.

What problems is Microsoft Teams solving and how is that benefiting you?
It's so easy to hop on a Teams call for video or phone conferencing, and I like that the app is very user-friendly, too. We use Zoom for external meetings with clients, but we've found that the process of creating Zoom links is onerous, and so whenever possible, we use Microsoft Teams for video conferencing.

Its very easy to integrate for 365 users, and as well its easily implemented for users of Slack. Easy to use in that it ONLY requires a link, this is a very big distinction from Zoom/Meet/Skype. The frequency of use for 365 users is usually daily, since it comes at no additional cost. Thankfully our organization has 365 included in our suite of programs. It has an amazing number of features, which are centered in one area for use. The customer support is very fast, and usually quite helpful with their breadth of knowledge.

What do you dislike about Microsoft Teams?
It's not as good for outside users, and non-365 users. Typically for meetings internal I'll use teams, but for external I lean on others. Unless of course that outside party is a familiar user, then I ALWAYS use teams. It's a very ""get used to it, and enjoy it"" product compared to ""this is built generally for everyone and anyone, but not something you need to diverge time into to learn"". For those that don't use teams, the breadth of tools provided may also be seen as ""redundant and overwhelming"".

What problems is Microsoft Teams solving and how is that benefiting you?
Helps us form instant / quick intenral videos and chat. While we primarily use google chat for company - internal file share and chat, we tend to do our meetings (below 25 people) through teams. It's great for smaller meetings that need to happen fast, and the bots they have int heir system are very helpful. Also this is the preferred meeting solution for other companies that are 365 users. Should a meeting go past 25-50+ people we will tend to use G-Meet or Zoom. 50-100+ we tend to use zoom. But it's nice how fast Teams meetings can be arranged, and when users are familiar with it, we can accomplish more than we can on the actual meeting than with competitor software.",4.5,"Name: Iyer A.

From the very first day of my Corporate career, I was introduced to Microsoft Teams, an effective platform to communicate and connect with your team members and anyone within the organization.

Key highlights/ advantages are-

1. Efficient meetings/ chats: You can now chat with any memeber of your organization easily and hassel free. One can also setup a call whenever required. one can also access the meeting notes and recording for future reference.

2. File sharing: Teams provide facility to send file to another member

3. Backup: It also allows seemless search option to look for old chats or files. Backup facility is also there to save important documents.

4. One can stay connected with teams from anywhere. With teams phone app, you don't need a system to be able to use the amazing features. One can login to the team from phone as well, hence increasing efficiency of the user.

5. Allows both Audio and Video calls: Teams has the feature to make both audio and video calls to the team members

The tool in short helps increased productivity and efficiency accross organization. Also it is most widely used tool nowadays across organizations

What do you dislike about Microsoft Teams?
Although the tool is widely used accross the organization, here are few disadvantages that I have observed-

1. Limit on number of groups that one can be part of-  There is a limit on number of channels that the user can be part of in the Teams app.

2. Requirement of Internet connectivity: Microsoft teams requires internet connectivity. Unstable or slow internet connectivity hinders the productivity.

3. Cost: While teams offers multiple benefits, it comes with the associated cost and other licensing requirements. Small organization might not be able to afford the same.

Even after the said limitation, teams has become a everyday need in any organization you work upon.

What problems is Microsoft Teams solving and how is that benefiting you?
From my experience, here are few issues that are being effectively handled by Microsoft teams-

1. Team Management: With easy chat options and both audio and video connectivity, teams helps in increasing the connectivity accross the organziation and improves productivity.

2. Easy Integration: Microsoft Teams seemlessly integrates with other 365 tools. It can act as a central hub for accessing other tools like outlook, sharepoint, etc.

MIcrosoft Teams is a great tool for Educators (an anyone else who needs to keep a calendar, share files, and meet virtually).  I like how I can EASILY set up meetings with others through email and calendar invites. The Teams meetings are a fantastic and secure alternative to other virtual programs like Zoom. Sharing files through Teams has also been a wonderful tool for me and my colleagues.  Teams is very easy to use, add to, and update.

What do you dislike about Microsoft Teams?
Even though Microsoft Teams has a lot of tools within the program, it can be a little confusing which one I really should use at times. One thing I wish it did better was notify me of calendar happenings. This is something that I have to set up every single time and when I put together a Team and named it, someone else had the same name on their Team and it allowed it. This was confusing. There was no notification of a duplicated name.

Recommendations to others considering Microsoft Teams:
My recommendation for anyone that will start using Microsoft Teams is to give it time. The more you use it the easier it is to use. Spend some time looking at all the tools it offers. The Help button is also a great tool if you need assistance.

What problems is Microsoft Teams solving and how is that benefiting you?

You can simply check threat intelligence as guest. No need to maintain and remember user ID or any other information. Most of the data which XForce returns is accurate. You can upload a file and check the risk as well. Most important is you can download it in STIX format. In IBM X Force we have a alertcon threat level which can help us for mostly all threat intelligence feeds. We also can manage dashboard which has all recent related threats and other information like early warning feed, Advanced threat protection feed. Malicious activity in 1 hr is the most helpful for the threat intelligence team in any organisation. It consists of data like Command and Control or Spam or Malware or Scanning and other vectors which were found in last 24hrs. Under dashboard we've Vulnerabilities which has the latest global security risks that are emerging at that point. We can integrate or make correlation rules on IBM X Force. We also can leverage the API keys to integrate IBM X Force to any of our threat intel feeds.

What do you dislike about IBM X-Force Exchange?

I like the ability to quickly upload our physical prints into digital. The onboarding process has been helpful, and Joomag is always there to help with any questions or concerns.

What do you dislike about Joomag?
I think the name of the brand should be considered to be changed. Some loading times on embedded publications or forms within publications can slow down load times. I've refreshed the tab when this happens, and it gets fixed. Also, I wouldn't say I liked how the app portion of the services was advertised on the website as part of the package, but it is an additional cost. For such a significant investment in the platform, it feels like specific clients should be given an app access to support their growth efforts. If this app truly gives a better experience, why would Joomag not want to work with its top customers to provide the best opportunity for success?

Joomag's PDF viewer is a great addition to our site and the ease of uploading our PDF publications is great.  Our Communications team uses their digital marketing tool to disseminate information to staff and other patrons and so far they like it.  I believe the ease of use of the digital tool is a plus along with the analytics that comes with it.  Overall, it is a great product that suits our needs at the moment.  Their pricing is very flexible and they worked with us for a price we could agree on.  Their support is amazing and always engaged when we have questions.

What do you dislike about Joomag?
As mentioned earlier, being an educational institution, accessibility is very important for us.  Joomag knows this and I believe they are working on making their PDF viewer more accessible, i.e. being able to use a keyboard alone to navigate a PDF and it's contents.  In the future if we find an affordable alternative that is 508 and WCAG compliant, we may have to check our options.

Service, until we had to close the account. Until the end, they were very accommodating and responsive.Over the 5 or 6 years we used the service.  Even creating custom solutions, in fact, ask them for custom solutions, ask them for many, many custom solutions that take hours for them to come up with solutions for. Drain their resource team dry.

What do you dislike about Joomag?
Up until I had to close the account I loved Joomag. But when clients asked us to move their publications to another service, having Joomag became a luxury that we could noit afford anymore. This was early in the year, and when we asked for a refund, less than 90 days into the new year, it was refused. That is over $700 that we will not be able to recover. Would you recommend a company that refused to provide a refund in those circumstances? This inflexibility is terrible policy in what is a very competitive segment and where there are many, many free options.

What problems is Joomag solving and how is that benefiting you?
It was a great service until I had to close the account in Q1. They helped build a custom publications page which worked like a library for us. It took a long time to work out.  You should ask them for this. That way they will do the work without charging you anything for it.  So when they screw you in the end for not even giving you a partial refund on a nearly $1000 annual subscription you will maybe feel one small iota of relief in knowing that they used up some of that expense in building a custom solution. THe only problem they cannot solve is what good customer service looks like.",0.0,"Name: NOT GIVEN

Echobox is an excellent tool for timely publishing media content on social networks. Visits to our site have increased drastically, thanks significantly to Echobox. We use many different groups and pages on FB and other social networks, and the experience with Echobox is worth recommending. Huge time savings and a significant increase in traffic to our site are the biggest advantages of Echobox compared to other tools for sharing content on social media.

What do you dislike about Echobox?
In the beginning, there were problems with resharing articles. These are the articles that Echobox republishes from time to time. An otherwise handy thing, but in the front, Echobox republished articles that were not current. That was a severe problem since we are a media outlet, and topicality is essential to our work. Fortunately, and thanks to the excellent support, we quickly resolved this. It is necessary to determine the kind of code (a particular letter or symbol) we will write in the URL when writing articles. In Echobox, we then set a rule so that articles that contain that ""code"" in the URL are never republished. Great!

What problems is Echobox solving and how is that benefiting you?
As a media portal, we publish many articles during the day. Manually uploading articles to social networks took much time for journalists and collaborators. We used other social media posting tools, but all involved ""manual"" input. Echobox does everything himself. That's a huge time saver. In addition, I am surprised by Echobox's ability to read algorithms and offer content to the right audience at the right time. It has significantly increased traffic to our site.",5.0,"Name: Ana M.

With Echobox, having all of our accounts on one tool has been a substantial time saver.

What do you dislike about Echobox?
En analysant les mots clés, les thèmes et les sujets abordés dans un article, Echobox pourrait générer des hashtags qui reflètent mieux le contenu de nos articles afin d'attirer un public plus engagé. Cette amélioration nous permettrait d'augmenter notre visibilité sur les réseaux sociaux et d'attirer un public plus intéressé par notre contenu. Nous le faisons pour l'instant manuellement.

Actuellement, Echobox est conçu pour fonctionner uniquement avec Facebook et Twitter. Cependant, nous utilisons de nombreux autres plateformes de réseaux sociaux, tels que LinkedIn, Instagram ou TikTok. Intégrer ces plateformes dans Echobox nous permettrait d'avoir une vue d'ensemble de notre présence sur les réseaux sociaux, ainsi que de publier via notre flux RSS sur ces plateformes

The most significant advantage is that Echobox knows when most of our users are online and then posts a message at the right time. This automatic posting is convenient because Echobox works 24/7, even when you are not (such as late at night or early in the morning).

We work with different teams on different brands, so you can imagine that getting and keeping an overview of content is crucial. Echobox helps us by providing a birds-eye view of what content has been posted and what is scheduled for later. This way, our content managers know exactly what to do (and what not).

Our teams don't have the time and resources to constantly check the algorithm for changes and do new experiments regarding posting. With Echobox, we're always first in line with the most recent algorithm changes.

What do you dislike about Echobox?
The disadvantage is that you still have to check and load a lot of content manually. If we don't look at Echobox everyday content is not queued to post. So the automatic posting features are not right for us at this time. Content is not always very 'human'.

Faced with an ever-changing algorithm and more than 200 published articles a day, knowing which articles to select and when to post them on Facebook in the 50-60 slots you have on any given day, is crucial to our business. Echobox is a miracle tool when it comes to that, plus it is super easy to use.

The overall experience with this secure SD-WAN is generally positive. The product excels in delivering high speed, reliable network performance, bolstered by ASIC acceleration. It's integrated features, particularly the next-generation firewall, provide robust protection, which is crucial for any modern network. The system's management is streamlined through advanced analytics and easy-to-use operational tools, making network administration more efficient. However, the initial setup complexity and some limitations in the available documentation and customisation options can be challenging. Theses aspects slightly temper the overall satisfaction but do not significantly detract from the product's strong performance and security.

The team that has supported us to get this tool up and running has been nothing short of amazing!  Not only is cunchr an easy to use tool, giving our managers access to data that would have taken our analysts days to compile, but we are also able to customize it for the ever changing needs and requests of our partners.  It has empowered us to make better decisions and see trending in seconds which has been invaluable to our team.

What do you dislike about crunchr?
There are views where I wish there was an easy way to get the trending view as a whole exported with one click instead of having to click into each data set and exporting individually.  I think there are some enhancements that are coming that will help us in this area but it does get clunky with large groups over a large timeframe.

What problems is crunchr solving and how is that benefiting you?
Turnover was a huge undertaking before we implemented crunchr.  We weren't doing it for all areas of the business because of the time it took to pull together.  Being able to have an overall view of turnover that could be updated for each population with just a click is such a game changer.

What do you dislike about crunchr?
Crunchr is only as good as the data that underlies it.  The recruiting analytics could be better and more advanced compensation-related KPIs would make this product even more comprehensive. The stories are in presentation format and not directly drillable, although one can get the insights from another part of the system.

We were doing monthly business review meetings, preparation of which took weeks and the data was static and at the level of reporting at best.

I find this feature particularly useful when working on complex projects that require integrating multiple systems.

The upsides of using Apache Synapse are numerous. It's a versatile, open-source ESB solution that's easy to use and customize.

It is more straightforward with dedicated modules for med tech studies. A lot of the EDC systems have pharma applications in mind, which just bogs down a platform for med device studies that just don't need those modules. With GGC, it is easy to set up and allows us to utilize those medical device features, making study configuration and data entry easy. When the study configuration and data entry are easy, we have fewer mistakes and queries than when we used other systems!

What do you dislike about Greenlight Guru Clinical?
There are some features that would be helpful, especially for some types of studies where the IRB has specific requirements for ICFs.

We used a paper-based system before. Since we're located in Europe and our clients have been located in Africa and the US, real-time data review was impossible.

By switching to GGC, we're able to review in real time without having to be on-site for the entirety of the data collection.

What do you dislike about Greenlight Guru Clinical?
Ease of use when setting up. I think it would be more helpful to be able to organize forms into folders and for the previous versions to remain hidden when using the search function. The process show rules are also a bit fickle and don't tend to follow a single line of logic. Also, not something I've worked on personnally, but it doesn't seem like the medical history form and the medications form connect.

The feature I like the best is how easy it is to pull reports from the data collected. This makes my job as trial manager a lot easier as I can easily pull relevant information out. Having a seperate section for queries raised is also very useful as it helps give an overview on who has completed their tasks.

What do you dislike about Greenlight Guru Clinical?
I think what was least helpful about SMART Trial was that a number of form templates were repeated - meaning that they had to be edited once the study was opened as not all forms were relevant. I think this couldve been solved by repeated testing in the set-up stage.

What do you dislike about Greenlight Guru Clinical?
Whilst the number of features is fine, some of the features still require fine tuning. These are just marginal improvements for a better experience and further streamline the system. For instance dates can not be included in row table fields, this forces to use free text fields which are prone to data entry errors, the randomization list export does not include subject numbers, the event of closing the study is not logged in the audit log (which is important as closing the study indicates the database lock), and I miss an site-related option to temporary disable enrolment at that site (currently the ""subjects"" permission needs to be removed from each collaborator).

Therabill has a clean and simple layout and style, which helps make it overall a user friendly software and not combersume. The simplicity is also easy on the eyes and mind, so I am not overwhelmed by all the options on one screen. The billing options are also great and make the billing process efficient and easy. Recently, it looks like after updates, there are now options to find payment reports that were not accessible before unless someone was an admin user. Therabill does seem to be working hard to hear requests and make appropriate updates to make Therabill comparable to the more widely used data management and billing softwares.

What do you dislike about TheraBill?
Therbill seems to be slow at times and not finish processing pages (maybe once a month). The ease of use on an iPad needs improvement. At times Therabill doesn't respond to the touch screen well or I can't seem to find the accurate place to touch for the screen to respond to the option I am trying to select (for example, logging out, I have to touch on and around the icon many times before it responds). It would be nice if there was a way to attach documents without having to scan them into PDF first.

Our e-commerce website was performing pretty well however, as per the trend we wanted to have a mobile application to bring in more customers. At first, we thought to outsource it however, after careful consideration, we hired the developers in-house and developed an app in three months.

The challenge was to make sure that our app worked perfectly when installed on any device. This routed us to look for cloud-based platforms and after some research we finalized the HeadSpin platform.

Using the platform was fairly simple our tester and developer both were able to upload the app and test it on any device they wanted, not even that cherry on the cake was that we were able to test the payment functionalities, language changes, and even after login features.

I love how the plays are automated and eliminate overthinking!  You can always skip a step in a play if necessary, but not having to decide what type  of voice message or email to use for each outreach  attempt has made me much faster at completing calls and really getting deep into my database every day.  I love that I can leave a recorded voicemail that is very detailed and specific on the fly and move on to the next call while it is being delivered.  The snippets for email are great as well.

I can call a customer, create notes within playbook so that it's easy to access what was previously discussed. I can also view past notes, and listen to calls I've made by pressing on the note I've created for that specific call. This gives me a huge benefit to gaining access to everything I have done throughout my day. Each call I make, is also placed on a report so that I can see how many calls I've made that were no answers, left voice messages, contacted, wrong numbers.. ect. Adding accounts to my XANT Playbooks is super easy and the application is an incredible guide to making sure you complete the tasks you need to, as it functions as a Task Sheet too. It's by far the best tool I've ever used! I can email from Playbooks as well! I linked my Playbooks with my email, and it tells me when I've received new emails, I can check events, check missed calls, and more! You can even create a calendar like page for when you need to schedule a future call!!

In my case, sometimes the language I would like to have people who speak Spanish but it's not a big because some members of my team don't speak very fluent English,previously if there was a person who supported us in Spanish,I also think that they should provide a separate training for the people who supervise equipment, so that we can get more out of the to make reports and listen to the recordings

I like that Playbooks offers automation for plays, the nueral send feature is nice as it may send an email at an odd hour, but when your customers might be more apt to view it.  Creating plays is pretty simple as well.  Creating your own templates and snippets is very easy and handy.  The customer service team is always responsive and very helpful and willing to solve any issue you might encounter.

What do you dislike about InsideSales?
I dislike that it tends to slow down Salesforce.  I don't like how it leaves a large space between the body of the email and your signature line, which can make it look like an auto-generated email.  The Outlook plugin is very lacking, it has basic features, but nothing spectacular. We also use ZoomInfo and there is no integration or easy way to put people in a play directly from ZoomInfo.

What do you dislike about InsideSales?
While customizable the only things i wish i could do different is change whether a step in a play calls for email vs. call to complete the step. however, i recognize that it is probably possible to create additional plays and simply remove from one play to another more email heavy version of the play for those clients that prefer email communication.  we just haven't done that yet.

Application Gateway offers a comprehensive suite of layer 7 load balancing features. At the application layer, it effectively routes traffic based on attributes such as URL or cookie, providing advanced load balancing capabilities. Additionally, it incorporates a built-in Web Application Firewall (WAF) to safeguard web applications against prevalent threats like SQL injection and cross-site scripting. Furthermore, it manages SSL termination, alleviating the backend servers from the burden of SSL encryption/decryption processes. The support for session affinity ensures that subsequent client requests are consistently directed to the same backend server, enhancing stability. Moreover, the URL-based routing functionality enables precise traffic routing to various backend pools based on specific URL paths, granting finer control over routing configurations.

What do you dislike about Azure Application Gateway?
The Application Gateway poses several limitations, such as its primary support for HTTP/HTTPS, neglecting other protocols and potentially restricting various application types. Scaling challenges emerge when faced with heavy traffic loads, exhibiting slower scalability compared to alternative Azure load balancing solutions. Moreover, its configuration complexity demands a comprehensive understanding of its multifaceted features. Cost escalation is likely as additional functionalities, like WAF, coupled with increased traffic, may result in higher billing. Additionally, performance concerns may arise in specific scenarios or high-traffic instances due to inherent design constraints and limitations.

What problems is Azure Application Gateway solving and how is that benefiting you?
The system efficiently distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers, preventing overload on any single server and thereby improving application performance. Additionally, it manages SSL termination, reducing the computational load on backend servers by decrypting traffic before reaching them. It incorporates a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to shield web applications from common vulnerabilities and attacks, bolstering their security measures. Moreover, it supports session persistence, enabling users to maintain their session state during interactions with the application—a crucial aspect for specific application types. Furthermore, the Application Gateway can intelligently route traffic based on URL paths to different backend services, allowing for enhanced flexibility and efficiency in handling requests. Finally, it ensures high availability configurations and offers auto-scaling based on demand, thus enhancing application availability and scalability.",4.0,"Name: Gajan  A.

ActionIQ is a great tool for storing our customer data and making it usable for campaign segmentation. I think in general it is set up in a way that makes sense, with all the different tabs clearly providing different activities you can do. There are many out of the box integrations which makes it very easy to continue making this the home for all of our data. The support team that I work with is lovely, always available, and have great problem-solving ""can-do"" attitudes.

What do you dislike about ActionIQ?
I dislike that attributes have to be written in SQL and I think it adds an unnecessary layer of complexity to the platform. I wish that you could just drag and drop fields like other simpler platforms, like Eloqua for example. I think there are often platform limitations and it seems like the kinks are still being worked through. There are often platform failures and unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a way to mass pass/unpause when these errors occur.

What problems is ActionIQ solving and how is that benefiting you?
It stores all of our data in one place from different sources like purchases, site activity, app activity, permissions, etc. It's great to have it all live in one place and gives us the ability to create robust segments using a breadth of data points.

The easy user interface empowers even the least technical business user to utilize and leverage the platform. As I often collaborate with marketers to use the platform and build out audiences, the fact that AIQ has a very seamless UI/UX ensures that they are effectively able to use the platform and it doesn't instill that daunting sentiment that oftentimes a more technical heavy platform would.

What do you dislike about ActionIQ?
The inability to have visibility into a lot of success/failure metrics. For example, when we enable a campaign/journey through AIQ - we would like to know how successful that campaign or journey was.

Recommendations to others considering ActionIQ:
The best way to become familiar with the tool is by diving straight in and playing around with its features and various tools. I think there are a multitude of capabilities that can be leveraged through AIQ if a user knows how to effectively implement them

What problems is ActionIQ solving and how is that benefiting you?
Within NMG we are currently trying to enable more personalized journeys and campaigns to reach a more refined list of users in a more specialized way to ultimately improve the overall user experience of our marketing methods.

52935,ActionIQ,https://www.g2.com/products/actioniq/reviews,4540460,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about ActionIQ?
From the Data Engineering perspective our company was able to load millions of customer records into Action IQ from a variety of structured and semi-structured data sources in a matter of days. Prior to using AIQ, we had various data silos sitting across our Postgres, Hive and S3 data lake stores and each silo had its own access and integration patterns. AIQ provided a platform with which we could simply and intuitively integrate data from all of these various services. We simply pulled Parquet file snapshots from each of the sources on a daily basis into a shared S3 location and let AIQ do the rest. Since the data ingestion process into AIQ is mostly the same for each disparate data source, we wrote a simple ETL job in PySpark and were able to reuse the same script for all 5 of our distinct data sources.

What do you dislike about ActionIQ?
It was easy enough to pass data (in Parquet format) over to a shared S3 location for AIQ to pick up but, we lost some visibility into the general CDP integration process after this data was passed over. We needed some assistance initially from the AIQ engineering team to verify that the data we were sending over was being joined and upserted in their platform as expected. The AIQ engineers who assisted us were very knowledgeable about the inner workings of their integration platform and the data verification process (from our load to their ingest) went pretty smoothly after the initial round of technical debriefing.

What problems is ActionIQ solving and how is that benefiting you?
Action IQ offered us a single platform to collect millions of customer records from several of our siloed data sources and to combine those records in a meaningful and actionable way (from the marketing perspective). It would have taken our company several years to create an AIQ-type platform of our own so, letting a proven CDP vendor do that work for us made a lot of sense. After setting up the initial pipeline of batch loads from our data stores into AIQ's shared ingest location, I haven't had to do any work to maintain or alter those pipelines. As a result of this frictionless integration, I now have more time to work on challenging and value-driven data engineering problems that don't involve the automated transfer of customer data to a third party vendor.",4.5,"Name: Alexei N.

Ability to copy previous audiences and flights for future activities.

What do you dislike about ActionIQ?
The flight process is bulky. There are too many steps to get something done.  Also, I wouldn't say I like getting a pushback whenever we would like a change or improvement.  It is apparent that AIQ is not looking to customize this tool for their clients.  In addition, I do not like when a change is made without the ability to test it first.  They never made a staging environment available for us to test functionality prior to promoting it to a live environment.  AIQ does not have the ability to provide email notifications when a file is uploaded and that would be helpful.

ActionIQ has helped us reduce strain on our analytics team by allowing our marketers to create their own audiences with a simple, intuitive UI. We  began using the platform in 2019 and have increased our usage every quarter not only with more marketing teams, but also with more advanced features and variables.

What problems is ActionIQ solving and how is that benefiting you?
We've achieved several unique problems with ActionIQ including but not limited to:

2. Join many tables in one interface to segment and target users, such as content, engagement, and feature usage

AIQ's user-friendly interface makes it easy to quickly begin getting insights on your audiences and develop segments from the get-go. The Journeys tool has been invaluable for us, allowing us to launch several automated tests and campaigns with ease. Launching these with just our prior tools would have been unimaginable and have taken much more resources. To see the tool improve year-over-year has also been fantastic. The fact that you can now connect journeys and adjust how often someone can re-enter a journey shows that the product is being improved with the marketer in mind.

What do you dislike about ActionIQ?
AIQ houses so much useful data, and more robust dashboard/visualization features would add immense value to the platform. Although you can track audiences over time, see audience overlaps, and view variable distributions, there are not many options past that. The dashboards are a little limiting in that you can't see all the raw data points or export the data to be used off the platform.

What problems is ActionIQ solving and how is that benefiting you?

It is extremely easy to manage with robust role based security and IP whitelisting to aide in keeping customer data secure.

What do you dislike about ActionIQ?
The only negative aspect we have yet to come across has been difficulty with our own data being incomplete or incorrect and not working well with the initial setup of the platform itself, but again, the Action IQ team was quick to find and implement a solution to these problems that kept us rolling and allowed us to realize value in our investment.

They do not allow people to cancel the subscription from within the platform. You have to contact the customer service. That's not very professional.  The customer support takes up to 2 days to answer. Unfortunately, there are not many features, and I haven't found any integration.

I like that I can easily make social graphics without getting onto more complicated platforms. Adding text is easy, adding in stock photos is SUPER easy. No need to call a graphic designer for every little thing. It can pump out 52 unique images in about 1.5 hours with copy included.

What do you dislike about RelayThat?
It can be glitchy to change the size of the text or image boxes in its templates. You use it kinda knowing that you are on a template and making changes to that format is not worth the effort.

53103,RelayThat,https://www.g2.com/products/relaythat/reviews,3141538,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about RelayThat?
The template-based concept makes it pretty simple from the get-go, because there aren't any major design choices to be made.  The entire process is basically drag-and-drop.  But the real beauty of the app is the ability to easily click between templates and/or between sizes and shapes of ""matched"" templates, to create multiple variations of the same thing with just a few clicks.  (This is amazing, for instance, if you need banner ads in six different sizes.)

Recent updates have added some helpful features, like the ability to snap objects to center.

What do you dislike about RelayThat?
Text, although quite adjustable within a pretty good range of parameters, has little ability to fine-tune it.  The updates, unfortunately, seem to have created glitches in a couple of the templates, where overlays seem to be at the wrong position in the layer stack and cover up TOO MANY elements.  There's no workaround for this with those particular templates, but it doesn't affect any of the  other templates.  Downloaded files are also very large, so I've taken to compressing them with another app after download.

What problems is RelayThat solving and how is that benefiting you?
This saves SO much time.  It's hard to overstate the benefit of being able to design ONE ad and then just click to ""convert"" that same ad to a different size and shape.  The kind of fiddling it takes to recreate an ad manually seems like mere minutes, but those minutes really add up.

This has become especially beneficial with Pinterest getting fussier about ""new content"" and preferring multiple images if a page is being pinned and repinned.  It's very easy to make numerous pin images in just a few minutes that would otherwise take hours.",5.0,"Name: Rachel R.

53103,RelayThat,https://www.g2.com/products/relaythat/reviews,5214249,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about RelayThat?
What I liked best was the innovative thought behind the tool. It made creating graphics fun and easy, it still had room to grow, but the corporate culture and how RelayThat treated its early adopters made the development of the tool worth the wait.

What do you dislike about RelayThat?
I dislike that you can not trust this company to fulfill its obligations or promises. As an early adopter of the tool, I invested in the software even though it was not ready for game time based on the fact that for our investment, I would be grandfathered into future development. The deal was that we would give valuable feedback and testing to help provide RelayThat with the data that it could use to give the market what it wanted.

Other early adopters and I would benefit from watching the value of our investment increase, and RelayThat would get market data for pennies on the dollar. Unfortunately, RelayThat was sold. And the new buyers not only stopped nearly all communication with the customers, but they also took the sleazy route of forking the payment structure to get out of their obligations to the early adopters.

The customers started to make inquiries about the status of the software and complained about the breach of the agreement, and Relay turned off the ability to actively comment or participate in the group.

On top of that, nearly all updates to the tool had stopped until recently, when they announced some very minor updates as if they were version 4.0 type updates. The software is the same now in 2021 as in 2018.

What this means is:

1. Bad Company Management
2. Treats Customers Unfairly
3. Does not Communicate with Stakeholders
4. Hides customer dissatisfaction
5. Does not actively support their software by providing updates and responding to customer feedback

Recommendations to others considering RelayThat:
I recommend that you avoid RelayThat. They do not actively support their software, and they have lost much of their good

Relay That has an extremely easy to use interface.  They have a number of sample campaigns which gives you a starting place, avoiding the dreaded blank page effect. I also find the templates helpful for idea generation, ways and options, even channels I hadn't considered.

What do you dislike about RelayThat?
They have not updated their templates in some time.  While I love the ones they have, I would appreciate at least one new one every six months or so for freshness and inspiration.

Recommendations to others considering RelayThat:
You get what you pay for.  While there are alternatives that start at free, they don't have the same professional look and feel.

IF you purchase a lifetime deal, it's a pretty good value. It makes it relatively simple to create social images at scale and establish a branded template.

What do you dislike about RelayThat?
A few things:

1) I purchased a lifetime subscription off AppSumo - my email address is changing and they are not allowing me to switch it. Meaning, I potentially won't be able to access the service in the future. When I asked them to update it, they said they wouldn't and wouldn't give me an explanation when I asked why. I mentioned that there weren't any stipulations of the sort on the deal that I purchased and they didn't respond to the email. I've since emailed them twice and they haven't responded. I find this to be quite predatory and unacceptable

RelayThat is just great. I'm not a graphic designer at all and I hate taking such long amounts of time to come up with graphics for my emails and social media posts. RelayThat makes creating graphics for that purpose, and others, very simple and they look great. They have a huge amount of templates to choose from and lots of editing capabilities.

While the editing functionality is great sometimes I find myself wanting to edit a particular template in a way that isn't possible. It's a minor thing, probably more of a pet peeve of mine than anything else. Usually in those cases I'll look to see if there's a different template that's closer to what I'm looking for.

Me gusta RelayThat debido a los magníficos diseños preaprobados de diseñador que aparecen con solo presionar un botón.

What do you dislike about RelayThat?
Hay diseños limitados para cada tamaño y no tenemos permitido usar tamaños personalizados. Entonces, aunque a algunos les pueden gustar estos diseños, puede que a los otros no. Tampoco existe el archivo AI, que creo que es crucial. Especialmente si no puedes encontrar un tamaño de imagen que se adapte a tus necesidades. Con el archivo AI, puedes ajustar los elementos de la imagen antes de adjuntarla a un contenido o una red social.

Por otro lado, Este software tiene algunas restricciones: la capacidad de cambiar la posición y el tamaño del texto no está en los diseños inteligentes y la herramienta carece de una función de exportación masiva (Digamos, si quiero exportar un mismo gráfico para portada de facebook, portada de youtube y portada de Twitter, una función única para exportar todo esto en un solo clic sería estupenda).

BitBay allows you to transact safely with counterparties from all over the world without wasting time on long-absorbent bank transfers and without paying high commissions.

BitBay is one of the most popular exchanges in Europe. One of its main advantages is the availability of many crypto values, thanks to which we can invest our funds in selected crypto values. BitBay has many options for withdrawing and depositing our funds. Another advantage of BitBay is that our account is entirely free and the only fee we pay is a very small commission for withdrawals and crypto vault sales. Another important advantage I've noticed is the security that BitBay is trying to provide to the user primarily encourages its customers to use two-step verification to provide an additional layer of protection, and also requires verification of transactions by e-mail code. BitBay has a very clear interface, which can be used by users who are just beginning their adventure with trading.

What do you dislike about BitBay?
One of the disadvantages of BitBay for some users can be the complicated way of verifying the account and the high fee for withdrawing our funds at the Euronet ATM, which is as high as 30 euros!

Ease of use. The transformations tool made it possible to even use this migration tool since we were going from a non-relational database to a relational one. We had to modify table names and column names along with mapping some data types. While it wasn't super straight forward it got it done. Whenever I had questions, customer service was easy to contact.

What do you dislike about Hevo Data?
Was a little confusing figuring out exactly how the schema mapper and transformations all played together. We had some issue with data types in postgres playing nice with the values being brought over from the dynamo DB. If you have some FK relationships, you can't specify (or not that I could find) an order in which to ingest the tables to avoid FK errors. Despite this, you can wait until the ingestion is complete and simply retry the failed events and they typically succeeded.

There are a couple of things I like about Hevo but the things that stand out are their customer support and ease-of-use.  I used other data ingestion tools in the past and none were as easy to work with as Hevo.  That doens't mean it doesn't allow powerful transformations though - it does.  When I get stuck and reach out to support, their response is quick (under 5 minutes) and if the issue has to be escalated, it's done so quickly.  The response from the escaltion team is equally as impressive.

Hevo Data makes it easy to connect to many data sources and build a BI-ready data warehouse.

When using the Models feature in Google BigQuery, the Hevo-created tables have a default expiration date, which, when reached, clears out the data from the table. This cleared out a client's BI solution one time and, while it was not a difficult fix (restoring the tables within BigQuery) it was not ideal.

Hevo is so simple and easy to hook up with a source data platform and a destination data platform. It really helped us out of a jam in figuring out our data warehouse strategy and implementation. We were recommended to Hevo by Snowflake and it was painless and effortless to get things moving.

I also like that it supports a wide variety of options for handling incremental data, such as change tracking (CT) in SQL Server - I've not found many other products that do. Many support change data capture (CDC) which Hevo does too, but CT is more lightweight and is a good SQL Server option. Hevo supports it but few others do.

What do you dislike about Hevo Data?
It would be nice if we could file pipelines under folders or categorise them in some way. It would also be great if we could duplicate pipelines. Let's say we have a bunch of source databases with the same schema and we want to do the same thing to all of them, with a different table prefix when they land in the destination. It would be awesome if we could manage pipelines at scale like this.

However, the biggest thing I dislike is, sadly, Hevo has a limit. It won't stop you mass-creating pipelines but there are only so many it can handle before it can't keep up with schedules.

Recommendations to others considering Hevo Data:
Hevo has a simple user interface, but the support is awesome and the pricing is very competitive.

What problems is Hevo Data solving and how is that benefiting you?
We use Hevo Data to transfer data from our transactional platforms into a single, consolidated data warehouse.

As an ""Essential"" level user, I see a lot of benefits from the variety of mark-up tools (and digital signature) features built into the software. Beyond mark-ups, features replace the basic PDF viewing and fillable form needs. Drawboard makes a near-perfect go-to software for these tools.

What do you dislike about Drawboard PDF?
The only downside experienced in the software is the lack of a view pane for reviewing a list of comments/notes in the document. As someone who has marked up extensive documents in my career and reviewed mark-ups by others, having a list of notes/comments (linked to the note's position on the page) is essential to a productive workflow. I highly recommend this feature to be developed ASAP to make this software the must-have application on my computer.

Drawboard PDF allows you to read your documents in multiple different formats, from sequential to book format.

Drawboard pdf comes in the free, non-business version, and the subscription business version comes with additional features such as merging documents, customizable color and style guides, templates, and many more features.

What do you dislike about Drawboard PDF?
The free version comes with all the basics a student or employee may require who doesn't need to create or edit pdfs regularly.

Drawboard PDF is a great software that I regularly use on my surface to make notes on PDFs. The system they use in order to change color/thickness or even make some sketches with preset forms is great. You can preset some pen styles you regularly use and then switch fast between them. Drawboard PDF also recognizes if you touch the screen with your stylus or with your hand. So there is no possibility to accidentally write something with your finger.  Also adding blank pages to an existing PDF is really easy so you can increase your space.
I use it also during online meetings or webinars, if I have to make some written examples since it works really good. On one hand you can show your presentation through the pdf slides and in case add some notes for everyone to see.

⚠️Shocking customer service by Donatas!⚠️

He uploaded an incorrect .csv file and made all of our shop inventory across multiple channels 0! This affected our sales as everything was showing as out of stock.

Luckily we had a recent copy of the inventory quantity so our staff stayed behind working hours to manually update the inventory for hundreds of products, as the integration sync can take up to a day to fully sync for bulk orders.

Had we not had the inventory report, it means you have to manually count all your stock again… and we have hundreds of thousands…

Donatas gave a vague apology trying to blame us, then started ignoring all of our messages.

Their is NO way to actually integrate products across platforms other that doing it individually and manually. Design uses SKU's which are random numbers generated on Amazon and each of its countries platforms.

Made suggestions over and over that they should be matched up by UPC or EAN code. This is the ONLY standard used across multiple platforms. They refused to listen, and make the software usable.

If you have more than 50-100 items across platforms such as Ebay, Amazon US, Amazon CA, Amazon MX, others, Wix and others then this product is TOTALLY USELESS to you. Because it requires you to match up each item individually.

Multiorders makes dealing with multiple ecommerce outlets look very easy. Since you get everything from new orders to products to customers in one application, it takes no effort at all to seamlessly manage more than one store.

The lack of a quick start guide. We have to manually show around our new employees which, while only taking around an hour, is still a bit of a hassle.

Also, their support team is always an email away to get any other issues fixed!

What do you dislike about Ansys HFSS?
The programme files are not backwards compatible. If you create a design on HFSS 2017, you cannot open it on a 2019!! This has led to some issues throughout my team.

Recommendations to others considering Ansys HFSS:
Highly recommend the product especially with the new crossover feature allowing the same design to be used in ICEPACK and thermal simulations and then with HFSS the EM simulation. This allows ease of editing the designing and measuring different effects.

What problems is Ansys HFSS solving and how is that benefiting you?
EM simulations. Typically antenna design and PCB layouts of antenna feeds.
Great optimisation and tuning features when parameterising variables correctly. This speeds up simulation time significantly. Also being able to run Python scripts through HFSS speeds up post processing and data exports.",4.5,"Name: NOT GIVEN

58337,Ansys HFSS,https://www.g2.com/products/ansys-hfss/reviews,4498155,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about Ansys HFSS?
I like the software's accuracy and the modeler is okay. One major pro is that if I copy and paste a solid from one project to another, I can go into the solid and still alter its dimensions. In other softwares, once you copy and paste, you can no longer edit to solid. In general, though, HFSS presents results I can trust, even if getting them can be irritating sometimes.

What do you dislike about Ansys HFSS?
HFSS had stability problems when I was using it. I don't know if it was a hardware issue, but crashes weren't as much of a rarity as I would have liked. It's not the most unstable software I have used  (that title goes to Altium), but more than once, I lost a good amount of work due to a crash mid-simulation. Furthermore HFSS erases the ability to undo model alterations after a simulation has begun. The software I use most frequently nowadays is CST Microwave Studio, which keeps track of all your actions in a history list. The downside to that is the more you work on a model, the longer it takes to update the history list after an edit is made, which is unfavorable. However, I would rather have the ability to undo at all after a simulation, especially if I change something that is not based on a parameter variable.

Aside from that, the thing about HFSS that I dislike the most is the presence of a certain error that would appear randomly but periodically across projects and what I had to do to get rid of it was never consistent (increasing my airbox size by a random amount, no matter how small, was even a solution sometimes). Unfortunately, I do not remember the text of the error (I apologize for how unhelpful that is), but it had something to do with the meshing I think and the error message was not specific. I do not think it was user error because, again, the cause and solution were never consistent.

I think the modeler needs work as well; CST has the option to define coordinate system positions based on model vertices, edges, and faces. This makes building models far more efficient. HFSS should adopt similar techniques. Further, I would really love the ability to extrude shapes off of the faces model objects.

Recommendations to others considering Ansys HFSS:
This software will work for you, but it is not without its headaches. I believe it is more accurate and versatile than CST Microwave Studio, but CST is faster in terms of modeling and simulation.

The only feature that is remotely good with this software, is when it comes ro rack elevations and layout. It has the ability to build rack elevations fairly easily. The ability to search for an asset quickly is also useful, however these are fairly basic features that you would expect from any DCIM software.

What do you dislike about RACKWISE DCiM X?
The product support is the worst I have ever experienced. They are quick to answer when you are purchasing, but once you have made the purchase, the support ghost entirely.

The Technical support team have been a very helpful  to work with and also it is easy to submit a service request through email. They are very much professional and expert on the product families.  We have got end to end support during the migration becauase the Implementation was bit tough when you move from other vendor to Arista. There were few minor challanges seen but the Arista technical team has helped to fix the hardware level issues immediately.

Its been more than 1.5 years we are running arista platform and planning to grab more products for the customers DC environment.

Network management and feature set is significantly better then other vendors. I have built custom automation sripts for network functions monitoring and alerts and also implemented CloudVision for network Telemetry which is great added value for network automation and Management.

i like its interface and simplicity. Also that it can be integrated with google calendar. It is the only tool that allows you create multiple projects for free with such level of sophistication. there is also a windows software.

What do you dislike about Agantty?
The manual function of sorting tasks needs to have more flexibility in order to allow for pushing tasks downward or upward; instead, it replaces the task location to the bottom of the list ( which is too much of effort to re-sort tasks again trying to bring the bottom tasks in the middle again).

if it is possible to sort them manually but without having to redo all the tasks all over again.

To give you an idea, if I want to put a task between an existing order, intuitively, the task should just come in between these tasks. However, such sorting would cause replacing of existing task location rather than pushing them downward.

Agantty, is free, shareable and fairly easy to customize. It's easy to add team members, color code tasks, and view the chart based on team member, calendar date, etc. Notes are very helpful for tracking progress, breaking down subtasks, and communicating between team members.

What do you dislike about Agantty?
Workflow (adding/editing items, changing dates/durations) interaction is somewhat clunky. I always struggle when attempting to find where to add a task to the chart especially. Remembering to click Save when updating the Notes section has been a bit frustrating. It seems to me that should be an autosave feature.

Recommendations to others considering Agantty:
Agantty is a quick and easy solution for small projects and limited team sizes. It fills a gap when traking and planning is needed, but more advanced tools are not necessary. It is truly for creating a gantt chart-style schedule, with predecessors and sucessors, but no more.

Yes, it is new to find a tool that has an attractive Gantt Chart, even when you enter the Dashboard and want to see the list of tasks is quite readable and you can take a tour of each of the configurations and notes generated.

Agantty, has a totally mordena aesthetic and great effects, are integration for the notices of each task to your mail meets the alerts that you are configuring.

What do you dislike about Agantty?
The effects it has can slow down the application, its integration in mobile devices is still waiting for improvements, it is fair and necessary a multi-language support that goes beyond ""German and English"", I think there may be a broader community that really wants to try or that is already testing and is with this negative point. It is advisable the improvement for future editions to generate a section in which you have view to your calendar in which your tasks are seen throughout. I think that's how you see how congested you are of tasks and activities.

It has created a unique and playful communication style, encouraging users to share spontaneous and authentic moments. Additionally, the Stories feature allows users to share a collection of photos and videos that disappear after 24 hours, providing a dynamic and time-sensitive way to share updates with friends.

What do you dislike about Snapchat?
Snapchat's user interface can be less intuitive for new users, and discovering features or understanding privacy settings might take some time. This learning curve can be a potential drawback for those looking for a more straightforward experience.

What problems is Snapchat solving and how is that benefiting you?
Users may be concerned about the permanence of their online communication, leading to hesitancy in sharing personal moments. Snapchat's primary feature is ephemeral messaging, where photos and videos disappear after being viewed, providing a sense of privacy and spontaneity. Traditional social media platforms often involve carefully curated and permanent posts, potentially fostering a less authentic online persona.Snapchat's emphasis on temporary content encourages users to share unfiltered and real-time moments, promoting authenticity in online communication.",4.0,"Name: NOT GIVEN

I don't like how many ads there are. In addition, the content is too much and necessary. The ""Discover"" feature takes away the purpose of Snapchat. It used to be really simple to send a story from Discover to a friend but now it is not. I also don't like how the map feature automatically tracks your traveling and how everyone can see that. It is unnecessary for all of my Snapchat contacts, or any for that matter, to see where I have been in a day. I feel as though it is very easy for people to stock others and that is unhealthy.

What do you dislike about iubenda?
It is quite pricy for what it offers (especially compared with competitors like Cookiebot or OneTrust).

Quick and easy to implement; however, if you want specific wording or layouts may be more challenging. I like that they stay up-to-date with the legalese needed. Their support has been helpful to resolve issues that we've run into.

What do you dislike about iubenda?
While their support is helpful once you get their attention, I've found that it's hard to get a response initially. On 3 occasions, I've had to prompt them repeatedly to respond.

I don't love some of the wording (would like it to be more user friendly) but it's a reasonable trade-off for a small company to not have to write it all from scratch.

The advanced configuration of the cookie consent banner leaves a lot to be desired. If you want anything other than the default view, you'll be writing markup and scripts. Not a big deal, but it's only turnkey if you accept all the defaults.

Since 2015 we have had only two representatives. They both still work there and are incredibly hard working and knowledgable. The program itself works very well. It is an extensive program with many different aspects to it, much more robust than other inventory exporters. They evolved very well when the car market changed because of covid. The whole program now is completely different than it was pre-pandemic which shows they are on top of the ball.

What do you dislike about vAuto Provision?
It is a complicated program that uses a lot of RAM and processing power so it frequently has tech issues. They lost a lot of their tech support people in the pandemic and don't have the best tech support like they used to have.

Microsoft Azure Compute is a really useful for virtualization of computing services. It's server less architecture, and scalability helps businesses not to incur huge costs for On premise systems for hosting their products and applications.
It uses Kubernatics to manage containers to run web services, and thus makes it easy to manage multiple apps. Batch processing is also one major use. It's usually a bit complicated to be implemented and specially it's difficult to transition from legacy code base to cloud based, and the dependencies often create problems. However Azure has excellent customer support and sometimes for big organizations dedicated resources to help and manage these services. However once set up, it's easy to use and manageable through one single portal. Integration with other softwares often poses a problem  but Azure support often helps, and more importantly Azure offers almost all tools for a complete Application, starting from Business, to Agile boards, Test Management, CICD, Reporting. Once a business is transitioned to a cloud based platform like Azure, frequency of use is  daily by everyone for all of these purposes by all stakeholders and maintain complete visibility and transparency of work.

What do you dislike about Microsoft Azure Compute?
The downside of Azure Compute is that it is sometimes complicated to be set up, specially when transition of services from on prem to cloud based is done.

What problems is Qi solving and how is that benefiting you?
We use Qi to track all types of data about our museum collections, and the relationships between different types of data: we currently record data about artwork, artists, museum locations, packaging materials, exhibitions, exhibition locations, bibliographic data and etc, and we continue to add data fields and data types as more people within the organization start using Qi to centrally track their work.
Using APIs and autotasks, we have automated data transfer from Qi to our digital asset management system and to our website.  We are now able to store artwork data in Qi, artwork images in our DAMS (NetX), and synchronize the systems so that the DAMS pulls artwork data to display along with images of the artwork, and Qi pulls thumbnails of the images in our DAMS to display along with the artwork records. Everything can now be stored in a centralized  system which is optimized to track and manage it (data in Qi CMS, image files in DAMS).  So you can see the artwork images and the data about the artwork in either system, even as the data and media files ""live"" in different systems.  In addition, our website now pulls data about artwork from Qi, and it pulls high-resolution images directly from the DAMS and displays both on a single page online. Museum-wide, our data is increasingly becoming centrally available to everyone as more people in different roles become comfortable using Qi regularly.",4.5,"Name: NOT GIVEN

It is very difficult to import your own APIs and have automated deployment. Akamai API Gateway has that functionality in its software but it is not easy to use and the learning curve is large.

How industry-specific it is, and customizable the software is to your unique business. It also has a user-friendly dashboard and syncs well with QuickBooks.

What do you dislike about SingleOps?
Be sure and clean with communication of the path you want to take during setup, as changing your mind later on, is a bit of a headache.  Be sure that you are vocal with your goals when being prompted with set up questions - it will uncover any gaps in communication specific to your business's needs.  For instance as our crews grew, and adjustments to operations needed to be made, it was harder for us to implement the new customizations quickly to fit the new needs of scheduling each crew separately, or a job across multiple crews on different days with gaps/delays due to rain etc

What do you like best about 123RF?

The quality of the images are exactly what you pay for, so you know exactly what you are getting and you get to choose what is right for the project that you are working on.

Oneups customer service is second to none and always respond within a day.

It has saved me so much time which regards to pulling reports and is so quick and easy to use. The data can be brought up immediately so we use the platform during 121s and as the data comes up so quick we can reflect on previous data too during the same meeting.

It's extremely user friendly which is great for the recruitment consultants as they can access their activity easily without minimal training.

The only reason I haven't given it full stars is there were some teething issues when the new dashboard was rolled out where missions and leaderboards weren't pulling through meaning for that period I had to switch through the new and old dashboard but it is all fixed now!

Another feature id like to see is when placements are removed from the CRM it is automatically removed from Oneup. The process of this still confuses me as at the beginning of the year it worked however recently stopped and when I asked why they agent said they need to do it themselves?

Great system nonetheless!

What do you dislike about OneUp Sales?
An extra cost to the business but that's okay.

It's not often you'd see a sales KPI platform labelled as ""fun"" - Though, as the majority of those in sales are competitive, the gamification of OneUp's services means teams and wider people in the business can all get involved in mini games/competitions.
Partnered with their real-time updates and chimes, it allows anyone's successes to be celebrated in the office together.
Easy to be used often, along with having it run in the background means it can be used seemless throughout the day along with integration to our CRM.

OneUp excels at giving us the information we require in an easy to read and digestable visual. The flexibility it provides with the timeframes is super useful and working with the team you can completely customise the metrics which are important to you, keeping it relevant and bespoke for your business. It collates the activity being input into our CRM in realtime, allowing us to dig into the data from our CRM that we would not otherwise be able to analyse. It's also great for creating engaging leagues, competitions and joint missions between colleagues and provides useful visuals associated with this to be displayed on TV screens in the office to keep the information front and centre to the sales floor. Another excellent feature is the ability to input and track targets, meaning we can keep on top of how we are performing against expectations. Customer service is very good.

What do you dislike about OneUp Sales?
Would be great to have a team competition feature (as opposed to 1vs1 which is currently the only option). Not much else to complain about.

71769,OneUp Sales,https://www.g2.com/products/oneup-sales/reviews,8699459,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about OneUp Sales?
Firstly, from a data and integration standpoint we have been able to integrate OneUp into our CRM Bullhorn to monitor key metrics, as well as create performance dashboards for our consultants to monitor their performance.

The data syncs and integrates pretty quickly to give you a virtual realtime  view of performance across the day, week and month.

It allows you to create bespoke reports that can be configured, exported into Excel to manipulate the data.

For us it forms part of our DNA for our Leadership Team, Data Analyst and Consultants to be able to manage their performance.

From a features standpoint there is a lot:

1) The Matrix view allows you to create specific dashboards to monitor performance measures
2) The motivate feature is great for looking at past performance, and allows you to create interactive leagure tables
3) Great to create particular slideshows focusing on KPIs for company performance.

What do you dislike about OneUp Sales?
Not a great deal of issues with OneUp, there sometimes is a delay in how it integrates specific metrics from our CRM. Also its difficult sometimes when monitoring reports from your Mobile to expand and view the data shown in its tables.

What problems is OneUp Sales solving and how is that benefiting you?
Its an easy to use platform for individuals to monitor and drive their performance

From the onboarding to the continual support offered by OneUp is superb. Our account manager Craig Taylor has taken us by the hand to get us setup and supported us through the past few months.

OneUp is a great way to identify areas of improvement for consultants allowing them to see exactly where they are to target across any KPIs you might want to measure.

Its a one stop shop for reviewing daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly targets with 1 or 2 clicks to find the MI you need. Its become a huge timesaver for reporting and analysing.

The ability to set incentives for individuals or teams is a great way of having your sales team focussed on the end goal and we have seen the team become more involved in team targets.

I couldn’t recommend OneUp more highly.

Keep up the great work guys!

What do you dislike about OneUp Sales?
I can’t think of any. Potentially if you are behind on targets then everyone in the sales team can see it but we haven’t had any issues with this it has encouraged those consultants to ""up their game"".

It also allows the management team to identify areas for support and training quickly.

The one downside to OneUp at the current moment is the ""Targets"" section. It is fairly clunky to use and not as user-friendly as I would have imagined but still doable with the correct full training. However, I am sure OneUp will find a way to resolve this in the near future.

What problems is OneUp Sales solving and how is that benefiting you?
It is benefiting us to see where we are against our revenue but also internal celebrations for deals which is also exciting for the sales team. OneUp has also helped us in different ways which I am sure is not usually used for but we have currently set weekly reminders on the TV automation flashes for things such as our weekly fire alarm test, weekly group activities etc.",4.5,"Name: Morgen T.

It's a great tool to get the visibility with what I'm doing. I know oneup have been working hard to work alongside vincere as well and this introduction is now slowly proving crucial to maximise my days

What do you dislike about OneUp Sales?
Sometimes it can be a bit slow and has it's blips, but this could also be backend related or vincere related so won't put all the blame on oneup here. I do still prefer the older looking layout compared to the new one as I feel it's harder to find stats now compared to how it looked previously (when wnating to compare my stats against the business)

One Up has a really intuitive and friendly user interface, with excellent reporting capabilities and wealth of tools for interaction and engagement. The tool has really enabled our team to own their own data and allowed us to increase the distribution of our leadership across the business. It has also provided a great opportunity for cross company communication (we have 9 international offices)

What do you dislike about OneUp Sales?
When we first joined OneUp there were a few things missing that would have added to the user experience (mainly around what data could be shown fo a particular placement). However OneUp are really customer centric and were able to develop the product inside very quick timescales. They are continuously improving the product and have the most approachable team.

What problems is OneUp Sales solving and how is that benefiting you?
OneUp solved an engagement challenge the business was facing. KPI data is a key driver for board decisions as well as the deployment of support services like our L&D function. We were worried that we didn't have an accurate picture of company performance because activity wasn't being logged on our CRM. With OneUp we are able to gamify and encourage far better logging of activity.

Another benefit is the ability to run company incentives in real time across all our international offices. This has really helped strengthen the feel of a company wide culture and allowed people to celebrate success better on a global scale.",5.0,"Name: Stephen R.

We have been engaged with Beyond Key for almost a decade now. We have been using Beyond Key's services for web development, custom software development, mobile applications and various scheduled/adhoc reports.
With the introduction of the new mandated product in NY state, we wanted to upgrade & update many of our software applications and systems to make those ready to handle the anticipated  challenges we expected to face in handling this new line of business effectively and efficiently. A big challenge in front of us was that our payment collection and money application system was old and not ready to handle the new volume and complexities this new line of business would pose.

What do you like best about Beyond Key Systems?
The project management from Beyond Key's side was very impressive. They were prepared for sprints, communicated effectively and timely about issues, did not miss any major deadlines.
They were aware about Agile Principles and followed Scrum very efficiently through out the project.
There was no major delays, bugs or miscommunications.

I found the readiness,availability and willingness of Beyond Key team members to support the mission of the project amazing.
They are excellent in following instructions and very easily adapt to work on Agile, Waterfall or any Hybrid methodologies.
Quick learning of business processes, excellent communication before, after and throughout project time & their technical expertise really makes them stand out.

Recommendations to others considering Beyond Key Systems:
I suggest to try their services once, may be with a small/pilot project. I believe , any client would like the experience and will work with them again.

What problems is Beyond Key Systems solving and how is that benefiting you?
Our goal was to provide our billing department with a user friendly web based application to allow them to review and manage the premiums in an accurate and efficient way.We had been working with Beyond Key for quite some time on various web based applications , reports and custom software developments although nothing of this sort of complexity and criticality. After performing an assessment of risk and doing cost/benefit analysis and based on our prior experience of working with Beyond Key we decided to go with them.
They rewrote the entire program with all the required validations, updates and new business rules. They also added many new features like performing run time analytics and showing appropriate guidance/warnings to users about potential incorrect/questionable wages or any under/over payments. The system was also integrated with our document management system and enabled users to print any notification/reminder letters for payment follow-ups with the click of a button in addition to many integrated reports to support the system and decision making.
The project was a big win! we were ready before time and had some room to add additional (nice to have) features on our solution. The business teams were excited and their efficiency went up a lot with the new solution.

It was the first solution i Found that I could start using almost right out of the box, without an insurmountable learning curve like other scraping solutions that I looked at. The premade actors really made it easy to get my feet wet and start extracting data. Later I moved on to schedules and integrations which just made my life entirely more easy. Now I just get new results and they're put in a database, autopilot for my needs.

What do you dislike about Apify?
Premade actors are great, but frankly, the rent+usage model that some of the actors have is just not ideal. I would like to test these out more thoroughly beyond a 3 day free trial. I would suggest that you consider a purely pay for usage model with slightly higher cost, but doping away with this rent + usage.

Developers can built their own solutions and easily publish on Apify store, which has over 1000 actors already. The support is pretty good for both users and developers.

What do you dislike about Apify?
There are some limitations, like not being possible to upload a file directly on the actor input or being able to retry failed requests from a actor run, it would be great to have a 'Retry failed requests' button.

74085,Apify,https://www.g2.com/products/apify/reviews,8470507,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about Apify?
Certainly! The aspect I find most appealing about Apify is how effortlessly it facilitates the creation of Apify actors. This functionality significantly reduces the complexity typically associated with building web scraping and automation tools. The process of developing these actors feels intuitive and user-friendly, even for individuals with varying levels of coding expertise.

Apify's approach to creating actors simplifies the journey from writing the code to deploying a functional application. With the platform's user-friendly interface and detailed documentation, I found it surprisingly easy to translate my scraping requirements into functional actors. The availability of pre-built libraries and templates further accelerates the development process, allowing me to leverage established coding practices and patterns.

The ease of creating Apify actors isn't just limited to the initial setup. The platform continues to impress during subsequent stages as well. Once the actor is crafted, the process of deploying it is seamless, ensuring that my code runs efficiently without the need for extensive configurations. This convenience drastically reduces the time and effort required to get a scraping or automation task up and running.

In essence, the simplicity of creating Apify actors empowers developers like me to focus on the core functionality of our scraping projects rather than getting bogged down by the intricacies of infrastructure and deployment. This feature undoubtedly enhances productivity and encourages more developers to explore the possibilities of web scraping and browser automation, even if they might not have extensive experience in these areas.

What do you dislike about Apify?
One aspect I find slightly unfavorable about Apify is the pricing, especially from the perspective of hobbyists like myself. While the platform undoubtedly offers a range of valuable features and functionalities, the cost might pose a barrier for individuals who are exploring web scraping and automation on a smaller scale or as a hobby. As someone looking to experiment and learn, a more budget-friendly pricing structure for hobbyist users would be greatly appreciated.

What problems is Apify solving and how is that benefiting you?
Apify is addressing the challenge of efficiently converting website scraping scripts into functional APIs, and this solution has been immensely beneficial for me. Previously, transforming scraping scripts into APIs was a time-consuming and intricate process, involving various technical considerations such as infrastructure setup, deployment, and maintenance. Apify streamlines this entire procedure, allowing me to easily convert my scraping scripts into functional APIs without delving into the complexities of server setup and management.

By offering a platform that automates the deployment and hosting of these APIs, Apify has significantly reduced the effort required on my part. This not only saves time but also eliminates the need for me to have a deep understanding of server configurations and networking. The solution effectively bridges the gap between web scraping and API creation, enabling me to quickly and efficiently convert my scraping projects into accessible and usable APIs.

Ultimately, Apify's capability to solve the challenge of converting scraping scripts into APIs has streamlined my workflow, enhanced efficiency, and opened up new possibilities for utilizing the data I extract from websites. It has empowered me to focus more on the creative aspects of my projects and less on the technical intricacies, thereby enriching my overall experience in web scraping and automation.",5.0,"Name: Abdurrachman M.

Between the awesome platform, the fantastic scrapers and the epic customer service, Apify is an absolute force.  I'm in the process of building my own technology company right now, so one big aspect of that is setting up an array of software systems for the management/administrative side of things.  And unfortunately I’ve run into a disappointingly long list of complicated platforms that have poor UX/UI, and I've also run into a wide range of poor/limited customer service.

But my experience with Apify, and specifically Tsveta, has been a wonderful breath of fresh air.  She's responsive, helpful, knowledgeable, communicates clearly, and best of all, deploys a suitable amount of empathy.  The Actors (scrapers) are also awesome, and I've barely scratched the surface of what this platform contains.  I can see myself getting a bit addicted to scraping.  It's intensely satisfying, lol.  Happy Scraping!!

What do you dislike about Apify?
Sometimes the individual Actors (scrapers) break, and you have to wait for them to get fixed, which causes some delays.

BUT, that's the nature of software, and they're scraping live systems/platforms, which have their own development roadmaps and ever-changing API's.  So it's likely a game of continuously monitoring and updating their Actors.  This is where Apify's customer service really shines.  They're super quick to dig into an issue and get it resolved.

What problems is Apify solving and how is that benefiting you?
I'm building a community marketplace that needs to scale across Canada fairly fast, and try to connect with thousands of businesses that match my ICP.  If I wasn't able to capture these by scraping, I would have had to pay for lists, work with economic development organization across Canada to slowly pull out the data from NAICS (and some of them might have charged as well), or I would have had to sleuth them manually.  This would have been a much longer, tedious and gross path to scale.  But after just a couple hours of scraping, I have over 10k businesses I can start reaching out to.",5.0,"Name: Conor P.

The Apify platform allows users to extract data from websites, process it, and store it in a structured manner. It offers a wide range of tools and services for web scraping, including a point-and-click web scraper, a low-level API for more advanced scraping tasks, and a library of prebuilt crawlers for common scraping scenarios.

Here are some pros of using Apify:

Ease of use: The point-and-click web scraper is intuitive and easy to use, even for users with no coding experience.

Scalability: Apify's cloud-based infrastructure allows users to scale their scraping tasks quickly without requiring complex setup or maintenance.

Speed: Apify's web scrapers can run concurrently, making it possible to scrape large volumes of data quickly.

Extensibility: Users can write custom code to extend the functionality of Apify's web scrapers or build their custom crawlers using the low-level API.

What do you dislike about Apify?
Here are some cons of using Apify:

Complexity: The low-level API and custom crawler functionality may be too complex for simple web scraping or programming users.

Dependency on third-party services: Some of Apify's features, such as its proxy service, rely on external providers, which may introduce additional cost or reliability concerns.

What problems is Apify solving and how is that benefiting you?
In terms of data mining and analysis, Apify can extract structured data from websites that can then be analyzed or integrated into other systems.

I have reviewed over the past few years several NIST type assessment tools and just renewed Security Studio again.  There are so many things that the S2 org tool does and does well.  I love the deliverables! The deliverables are easy to create and are easy to present to other non-technical shareholders to get that “buy in” when we prioritize our goals for infosec.   The industry comparison FISA score is genius and I base one of my departments KPI’s off of improving that score month over month.  I can easily measure our remediation  investments against our improvement or risk.  When I did security consulting over the years, I would present a report and the following year would find the same high priority issues with nothing accomplished.   This tool seems to drive action.   S2 continues to refine the tool and open to suggestions.  The support are responsive and rock stars!

What do you dislike about SecurityStudio?

Tech Reformers, LLC uses S2org to provide evidence of compliance across 4 areas of risk. We like how clients upload policies and procedures to be reviewed by our certified experts. It helps us create a roadmap to improve security. Security Studio lets us partner with our clients in a productive and efficient manner. The tool allows us to build  long term relationships with our clients as, together, we work to improve security and lower risk across the 4 domains: Administrative Controls, Physical Controls, Internal Technical Controls, and External Technical Controls.

What do you dislike about SecurityStudio?
The surveys can be time consuming. But I like how Security Studio allows for 3 levels with the first, L1, being a shorter survey to get a handle on your security posture. By starting clients on the right level survey it alleviates the problem of starting with a survey that is just too cumbersome for an organization starting its security and risk compliance journey. With the Security Studio team, we even created a free assessment that allows for any of our target customers in Education Management to get a quick snapshot of how they stand.

Recommendations to others considering SecurityStudio:
I recommend Security Studion for organizations looking of a product focused on documenting security and risk backed by a company giving excellent customer support. I recommend it for those looking for a flexible product that can be customized for the user.

What problems is SecurityStudio solving and how is that benefiting you?
Tech Reformers wants a standards-based tool to measure security risk posture across the organizations with whom we consult. Security Studio provides evidence with an easy to understand score for executives with the backup material for auditors.

The SecurityStudio products are very easy to understand and navigate with the latest update. We have been using S2 org and I have used and recommended S2 me personally. These tools give the users a S2 score. S2 scores are easy for people from any background to understand. We have been able to use the S2 org results to work on focusing our security efforts in schools. The information given out of the S2 org assessments is very valuable!

What do you dislike about SecurityStudio?
I have been overall happy. My only hurdle has been some of the constant changes and updates. For a while it felt like as soon as I got a grasp on the platform an update would happen and shift things a little. That has settled down now as the tools have matures more. I get that this was just growing pains so it's completely understandable to be a part of it. I'm looking forward to using the S2 org for quite some time to see growth and progress for our security adventures.

What problems is SecurityStudio solving and how is that benefiting you?
We started doing these assessments to get on a continuous security improvement path. As more breaches occur, school district leadership became very concerned about making sure they were taking actions to ensure student and staff safety. This tool gives us measurable progress towards the goal of keeping students and staff secure in a very easy to understand way. I approached this like schools approach standardized testing: show continual score improvement over time. So far we are only in with the initial assessment. After completing that, we have been spending time digesting the results and making a plan to implement solutions. The biggest benefit of this tool is the score.

What do you dislike about SecurityStudio?
There are still a few workflow items when working within the tool I would like to see changed.  When working with the list of vendors that have classifications to be reviewed, after each vendor it returns to the list of vendors instead of the list of classifications.  Or after approving the classification if it would just continue to the next vendor, that would be a huge time saver.

There also could be a few more definitions of terminology right in the tool instead of having to go to the Help area to know the definition of Confidential and Physical/Logical Access, etc.

The design tools are deceptively easy to use.  In reality, the proof they send (that the user must approve) may end up looking nothing like the final product. As a result, the postcards mailed out may or may not look like the proof. In my case, the postcards that went out look pretty shabby. The customer ""service"" is essentially an email indicating that they will not take responsibility for their printing error. I've been a customer of Amazing Mail for 10 years. They lost me with this poor-quality product, absence of accountability, and poor customer service.

81591,Kicksta,https://www.g2.com/products/kicksta/reviews,4937805,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about Kicksta?
Kicksta is a social connection establishment tool similar to instacart. An organization could market its brand by enrolling in Kicksta and look for users to get connected. The connected users eventually become the followers of your organization's brand and promote it if it deserves. The tool tries its best to establish connections with the right contacts who have a similar profile in the market. The business of your brand grows with the right set of followers and contacts.

What do you dislike about Kicksta?
The enrollment fee is quite pricey. It's not easy to get followers as many of them may continue to be only on Instacart. The process of establishing the followers list and targeting a business growth could be a bit long in terms of time. The individuals have to decide for themselves on whether or not to follow your brand, which means that you need to perform your due diligence on your brand before getting enrolled. The number of followers who you would get for your organization cannot be assessed beforehand. They slowly get added to the list based on what the brand depicts.

Recommendations to others considering Kicksta:
Consider Kicksta if you are a small business organization looking to promote your brand for broader outreach, evaluate this tool. Clearly define the capabilities of your brand and the values that the organization brand has to offer before advertising it on kicksta. Set both short term and long-term goals to promote so that you could attract followers from both these categories.

What problems is Kicksta solving and how is that benefiting you?
The brand of our organization was advertised on Kicksta.  The list of right followers was able to promote the brand name and business values. The business took off with the right partners, and the right clients were identified to support the business. Followers who run similar nature of business in their organizations are able to collaborate their insights and that's a huge benefit.

The best part of Kicksta was the user dashboard where you could see performance and select options for the tool/service. It was easy to navigate and well laid out for a good user experience.

What do you dislike about Kicksta?
Their explanation around what they do and how they do it is vague, and it was unclear whether any of the change I made to our account led to different results. It was a huge waste of time to try to learn how to use the tool and understand what was and wasn't working when ultimately there was very little evidence of anything positive happening on our social media accounts after using the tool.

Kicksta didn't solve any problems.

It was easy to sign up and get connected

What do you dislike about Kicksta?
Unfortunately, the software never logged into my account to try to drive growth.  Contacted customer service and was assured on multiple occasions that it would start within 24 hours. It never did.

Further, I was not able to resolve this despite almost daily contact with customer service. Their only resolution was to give me credit on next month's fee.  But given they have not driven any growth, I will not be renewing my subscription.

The fact that I canceled their service!!

What do you dislike about Kicksta?
These clowns are just after your money and when issues arise they won't help. I asked for local followers (in the Los Angeles, CA, USA area) & they ended up getting me a lot of followers in the country of Brazil?!?! Then they started adding a lot of Realtors which I told them I did not want. Basically they caused more harm than good to my Instagram account. But if you ask for a refund, they will try to hide behind their very strict cancellation policy (even when they are doing a horrible job)! Do not do business with this company!!!

We love that Kicksta lets us optimize our followers and grow organically without us having to spend tons of time one our account growth. The dashboard is easy to use and breaks down information into tabs - targets, posts, analytics, filters, etc.

That I can login and track growth progress, easily edit 'targets', and manage multiple client accounts.

What do you dislike about Kicksta?
That there is no 'export report to PDF/link' type feature; hard to really call this a dis-like, but it's the only area that makes selling/visualizing this added charge to clients. I know Kicksta said they are working on it, though!

Recommendations to others considering Kicksta:
Get a good idea of which 'targets' really make sense for your/a clients' brand in terms of other accounts' audiences- that's the key. You're looking for where your brand will get the most traction that it is not currently, and then be ready to 'work it' continually- there is no set-it-and-forget-it with these things.

Giving SOME kind of service to Instagram, for brands that we refresh and manage.
Before this, we would create styleguides, pair clients w/photographers in their erea, or even create seasonal graphics for posting, but we are just simply not a social media house.
Really, to 'manage' an Instagram, takes many hours, photography, copywriting, brand knowledge, hashtag savvy, and more- we cannot do the work of 'running' our clients' Instagram.

Documents can be easily uploaded either manually, or via a manifest file if you have a large number of files. Uploading manually is simple using the drag and drop interface, which then prompts users to tag them with the appropriate metadata. This process can be sped up by using “drag and duplicate” feature.

riteSCAN allows our material handlers to move components, parts, sub-assemblies and document within SysPro their location instantly.  As fast as some parts need to move from one work center to another or warehouse to work center, riteSCAN allows real-time updating of inventory movements within SysPro that is crucial to allow the next phase or job to start and be completed timely on the mfg floor and in the ERP software.  It also allows our receiving person to record the receipt of purchased materials and components at the receiving dock, allowing for immediate relocation into the warehouse or to a work center as needed as it is visible within the ERP software (SysPro) without delay.

What do you dislike about riteSCAN?
riteSOFT also offers a sales order picking/fulfillment function but this doesn't really fit our parts picking methods.  The screen also does not allow for seeing the entire sales order so that the picker can choose the best sequence to pull and pack parts for shipping.

What problems is riteSCAN solving and how is that benefiting you?
riteSCAN solved the huge delays (hours to days) we were experiencing when the whole inventory process from receiving to storage to work center staging and delivery was manual paper based.  Information would not be entered into the ERP software timely or the paper document would even be lost, causing visibility issues within the ERP software to know where raw material, components, or sub-assemblies were physically.  This caused delays in processing jobs through the ERP software (SysPro) which made for an entirely different mess of out of sequence processed jobs, fictitious qty adjustments, and an overall inability to trust the accuracy of the inventory within the ERP software.  riteSCAN made all of this real-time posting which eliminated all of the problems mentioned and put trust back into the ERP inventory numbers.",5.0,"Name: David D.

Social Networking Software allows users to schedule content from multiple platforms in one place, saving time and other resources. The better ones go beyond scheduling and allow reporting on performance that can be brought into meetings with clients or general stakeholders. The more in-depth tools allow for social listening and allow users to build out libraries of content, including hashtags and tags that make reporting easier.

What do you dislike about Social Networking Software?
The APIs that feed info into the Social Networking Software have limitations and periodically disconnect. It can be annoying to have to reconnect, but it's better than having to go to each platform every time you want to make a post or look up information about how content is performing. Reporting data can sometimes be inconsistent or incomplete, but the ability to see overall performance across multiple platforms is very valuable.

Wheelhouse lets us compare pricing with our competitors, which makes having the price advantage easy.  The fact that Wheelhouse caught the Bruce Springsteen concert in town and raised prices accordingly made it so that Wheelhouse was paying for itself!

What do you dislike about Wheelhouse?
They have three pricing options (conservative, regular, and aggressive).  However, I wish this was more of a sliding scale and we had more options.  Currently our Airbnb market is severely undercutting prices so that the illegal Airbnbs can fill up as much as possible before they get shut down, but the Conservative price point doesn't compare to their prices, so I have to manually add in our current price point.

I tried other automatic pricing services; Wheelhouse is by far the best I've seen. As an Airbnb host, I feel confident that my pricing is appropriate, and I'm not leaving money on the table by over- or under-pricing my property. They have terrific options for granular control of pricing parameters that are far better and easier to use than what Airbnb offers. They also provide automatic comp sets that are very useful for understanding the local market.

Every time I have a question, customer service gets back to me in moments, even in the middle of the night. Wheelhouse does it right. It's the kind of company you hope to find when you're looking for quality.

An absolutely essential tool to optimize revenue from an Airbnb listing. More than enough dials and knobs to tweak for those interested, but it's also effective with defaults. I saw a substantial revenue increase (Airbnb's built-in pricing is far below market) and was able to dial in minimum stays per check-in day to optimize stay length and minimize turnovers. Incredible value for the price. When occasionally needed, support is super prompt and expert-level from the first interaction.

Quickbooks Payments is the easiest way for us to accept payments from invoices sent from Quickbooks and has made it much easier for prospective clients to pay their deposit right there in their Quickbooks account overview. Because Quickbooks is a product of Intuit, which is a company many know and trust, they trust the payment option through Quickbooks which helps us close more deals.

What do you dislike about QuickBooks Payments?
The fees imposed on the seller (us) can take a big chunk of the profit from each transaction, which is why we have started to addd a fee for each transaction to cover these costs. Thus, we are taking the fees imposed on us and imposing them on our clients. That does not feel good and does not make the customers feel good about us. I wish Quickbooks would make this fee part of the customer's payment transaction (as in show the customer that this is imposed by QB not us).

Ad Badger's bidding algorithm does an excellent job of managing PPC bids for small brands.

With sales under $10 million and thousands of search terms, other bidding software quickly loses control because it chases the most recent keyword sale with agressive bid changes.

We use Ad Badger because its algorithm provides the best balance of  responsiveness to daily market changes with long run conversion rate data.

We also highly value Ad Badger's flexibility.  With other software and agencies we were forced to start our campaigns over from scratch.  Ad Badger allowed us to apply its bidding algorithm to our existing campaigns.  This enables us to continue using our existing dashboards and analytics to monitor the business making Ad Badger very easy to integrate.

What do you dislike about Ad Badger?
The user interface works well enough to mange our campaigns and make manual bid adjustments in bulk when necessary.

For advanced analytics and business dashboards, we continue to rely on software built for that purpose.

The overall user experience is nice and friendly. It is quick to learn and easy to use and apply. I enjoy the fact that there are many integrations on many open source platforms. Polarity integrates Google's Chromium and Internet Explorer's Trident Web rendering engines into a single program. There are some additional tools like speech recognition that make it a bonus. It cleans up web browsing and declutters your workspace when many tabs are opening while browsing.

What do you dislike about Polarity?
There are still some bugs in the software, some crashing that happens. The issue is ultimately out of my control, so until they fix them on their end, it won't be software that I can continuously use. Overall, Polarity doesn't offer anything too special or unique; it prioritizes itself on simplicity and ease of use. In the grand scheme of things, there aren't many things to 'dislike' about Polarity, but it's a software that is neither simplified enough to inexperienced users nor sophisticated sufficient for the hardcore users with full customization and tweaks.

What problems is Polarity solving and how is that benefiting you?

IPInfo.io gave us a lifeline--for a small business that doesn't have the resources to combat and report malicious emails to the service providers. Small and medium businesses are targets of scams, phishing emails, and man-in-the-middle attacks often because we don't have enough resources that bigger corporations have.

IPInfo.io made it possible to geolocate and report these attacks and phishing scams to the correct service providers. What's more, IPInfo's API allows these tasks to be completely automated.

After hundreds of IP looksups, I have yet to find incorrect geolocation data in Europe and North America. A handful of proximity matches occurred in Asia and South America. And of the five geolocation data service providers I tested, IPInfo provides the most accurate data I could find.

What do you dislike about IPinfo?
There's nothing I dislike about IPInfo.io. I do occasionally find incorrect abuse contact information that has not been updated by the service providers. Sometimes the service providers either forget to update the contact information or purposely leave the wrong contact information.

I like the customizable aspect, although perhaps it could be a little more flexible to properly make the widget feel and look like it's part of the sites posted on.

While some might find UserWay's pricing steeper than other web accessibility tools, weighing the cost against the service quality, features, and support. Most important is, that it is one solution you can rely on and you don´t need multiple separate tools. Besides this smaller pricing issue, we didn´t have issues - in the first few days it was a bit confusing but after a while, we were used to finding all relevant functions.

What problems is UserWay solving and how is that benefiting you?
UserWay enhances web accessibility, ensuring websites are inclusive for those with disabilities. We use it in customer and own projects.  Aligning with standards like WCAG 2.1 it helps sites avoid legal complications and meet accessibility mandates. Embracing accessibility with UserWay protect us against loss in brand's reputation, underscoring a commitment to inclusivity. The platform's tools, from screen readers to text resizing, ensure everyone can navigate and interact with websites effectively. This not only offers a smoother experience for users with disabilities but also boosts overall user satisfaction and engagement.",4.5,"Name: Dirk E.

This is the first Manufacturing ERP built and designed for the modern era. Fulcrum is constantly changing and growing while maintaining a culture with its customers that most companies strive for. When choosing Fulcrum, you become a part of this close-knit community where you're on a first-name basis with most of their team and other Fulcrum users. Everyone involved Is so enthusiastic about helping one another. The culture alone puts Fulcrum above Jobboss; Fulcrum's pure focus is providing a product that constantly meets your need as you expand and grow. The Platform Is great and open-ended, meaning no matter your size or specialization in the manufacturing world, you can tailor Fulcrum to meet your needs. Great for service providers to turn-key providers fulcrum can adapt and support your business. With weekly update rollouts, Fulcrum finds new ways to bring innovation to your company.

The key difference compared to other ERP Systems is that everything revolves around the Item you are producing and the machines you're running it on. Employees or companies are not tied to a particular item or device, allowing for flexible solutions while reducing redundancy. Everyone is in sync and aware of jobs, articles, revisions and changes going on with an order from your office to your shop floor.

Fulcrum should be your first choice to keep your company competitive while fostering a foundation to grow, especially in automation. Fulcrum's open API opens integration with many powerful tools, allowing basic communication improvements to complete a department's workflow automation.

What do you dislike about Fulcrum?
Honestly? Diskiles about Fulcrum are so short-lived with my company. With weekly updates and improvements, what might be a pain this week could easily be solved following an update. The platform is constantly changing, and Fulcrum is always listening to feedback. If something may not work for you in particular, reach out to your Rep, I guarantee they are either already working on an update for it or have solutions in place to help adapt Fulcrum to your needs.

Listing my current dislikes would be mute because Fulcrum today may be different from he Fulcrum tomorrow.

105857,Fulcrum,https://www.g2.com/products/fulcrum-fulcrum/reviews,8026756,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about Fulcrum?
We looked at various ERP systems as a small to medium-sized medical device manufacturer. Ultimately, we decided on Fulcrum for a variety of reasons:

-	User-friendly interface and ease of use
-	The scheduling platform was superior to other ERPs.
-	Not limited to # of users, based on the size of the company then every employee has access without additional costs (Huge for us to get entire buy-in and use from all employees top to bottom)
-	Job tracking and cost analysis
-	3D part viewer under each item
- Continually releasing updates and new features at no additional costs

Fulcrum was an easy and right choice for Qualitex, Inc. It has been a tremendous help in improving our process flow and scheduling to help ensure on-time deliveries. The cost analysis and reporting features are enormous for ensuring we maintain margins and where we can improve. The onboarding process with Fulcrum was in-depth and systematic to ensure we ran smoothly without hiccups. We integrated with QuickBooks, and while we were initially nervous about that, the Fulcrum team ensured everything went well.

I would tell anyone considering an ERP to consider Fulcrum strongly, do the demos, talk with the team and let them show you the power behind it.

What do you dislike about Fulcrum?
There isn't much not to like about Fulcrum. I've expressed my only ""dislikes"" to their product development team.

- A way to track tooling/fixturing costs under items & jobs (there are roundabout ways to do this, but a straightforward way would be excellent)
- When logging in and out of jobs on the job tracker, it would be nice to be able to set a stop time for when you are running lights out overnight and know when the machine will stop at a specific time (currently, you have to go manually enter the time)
- A little more flexibility in controlling the schedule where you see fit. The scheduler is very powerful and uses some form of algorithm and AI to generate the best manufacturing schedule. However, as we all know from running businesses, there is still a human element. You can turn a setting on to drag and drop the scheduling, but it can be cumbersome.

All the items about there are work-around ways to achieve what you want, but if they were more straightforward, it would save some time and give visibility.

105857,Fulcrum,https://www.g2.com/products/fulcrum-fulcrum/reviews,7880479,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about Fulcrum?
My biggest draws towards Fulcrum were the user interface and the scheduler. During my research, Fulcrum appeared to be to only MRP with an auto-scheduling feature. During our launch process, we had to tweak it a little bit, but once it was fined tuned, it began to represent what we needed on a day to day basis. We barely have to do any manual scheduling any more.

The user interface was a crucial element for me, as my workforce is primarily welders, who have little computer experience in the workplace. I needed an easy-to-use, and easy-to-learn user interface that was going to help the process. Fulcrum got it right by making a user interface on the job tracker that is click-and-play.

I also have to say during my trial runs of different software, Fulcrum had the best customer support. If you have worked with any management software before, you will discover that Fulcrum is easy to set up. Even though it's fairly easy, you have a dedicated launch manager with you every step of the way to answer questions, help overcome challenges, and help make you successful. The other MRPs on the market were hard to learn, and they didn't set you up for success.

Fulcrum is also receives updates weekly and is built on modern web-based technology. It can work on any device and is accessible from anywhere in the world. It's great for me, as I oversee my business remotely often.

What do you dislike about Fulcrum?
The biggest feature I am missing in Fulcrum is bulk editing or the ability to export all items, modify them in excel, and reimport them. Most my products are similar, but have slight variations, so when I need to make a change I have to go through one item at a time to make the changes happen. It is important during your launch process to consider how you may need to change your products in the future when building out your bill of materials, routings, and subcomponents.

What problems is Fulcrum solving and how is that benefiting you?
Fulcrum is saving us time and money by improving our, scheduling, inventory tracking, purchasing, and automation processes. We launched an ecommerce storefront on shopify, and Fulcrum integrates seamlessly. Once an order is placed on the store, it goes straight into Fulcrum. Fulcrum also reports to shopify our current product inventory levels. Once we ship the item in Fulcrum, it notifies shopify that the order is fulfilled.

On the operations side, we have reduced our inventory checking from daily to weekly, saving us important time. We are also saving approximately an hour every purchase order we place, as Fulcrum shows you what materials you need to purchase and making a PO is as simple as clicking a button to add the item to the PO and it will email directly to our vendor. It integrates straight into quickbooks and allows us to link our bill.

We are saving alot of manual data entry now.

Also, Fulcrum is allowing me to manage my manufacturing operations remotely. That is not common in our industry, but all of the data that Fulcrum offers allows me to make decisions even if I'm not present.",5.0,"Name: Roggen F.

Pros:

Looks great

Intuitive for those familiar with computers, laid out in an easy to navigate way for those that aren’t

Fast job processing speed, and fast repeat part reorders and previous job traceability

Paperless nature make in-process print revisions easy to execute
Everything is connected, so if you have a PO#, Quote#, job#, part#, or even raw material #, you can find your way to the information you need in the system.

The inventory system is very transparent, and it has all sorts of options for note taking when it comes to inventory changes.

Customer support is spectacular.

The launch process went very smoothly for us, and having personal support assigned to us is fantastic. Any issues we come across are resolved very quickly.

The dev team is on top of it, with frequent updates, many of them being directly from customer feedback. We've been with the company less than 6 months, and at least 1 of our requests has already been implemented as a feature, along with several other changes we wanted already being in the pipes before we suggested them.

What do you dislike about Fulcrum?
Cons:
The reports section is the weakest section for us. It does not output the data in a way that can be quickly read (Pretty charts and meters), although it does give you most of what you need to generate those charts and reports. The support staff is also excellent about generating custom reports that automatically update when something the system won’t make a report for is needed.

Associating multiple jobs to one PO is more limited than we would like, but that is on the roadmap

Once a job has been started, edits to it are limited. This has already been improved by small updates since we started using it though and I have no doubts it will be fully addressed.

The fully online nature of the system means that an internet outage leaves you in the dark. Nothing to be done about this though.

The scheduling system is decent, but you need to accurately estimate production times for each part/job for it to be useful (as is expected), and the display in the schedule tab is not as easy to read as I would like. (I like Gantt charts) It does lay out upcoming due jobs in the jobs tab via sorting by production date though, and that's still loads better than how we were handling it previously.

I run a 10 person cut and sew garment factory in Detroit.  We're a small and bootstrapped business that needed a tech tool to scale to the next level, but hadn't found the right solution, and more importantly that fit our very small budget.  Fulcrum consolidated all of our 30+ Excel sheets into one easy to use format.  It keeps us organized and all on the same page.  It also saved a ton of time from entering data and cleaning data. My staff was all tracking production times on their phones and with pen and paper before manually entering it into Excel at the end of each day, now it's all done in real time via iPads that everyone keeps at their work station.

The Fulcrum team is all amazing and very accessible even a year after implementation to help us with all issues that arise.  I couldn't recommend it more for small manufacturers.

What do you dislike about Fulcrum?
Sometimes there is a little lag between data entered and when it shows up in the system, which throws my shop staff off when everything isn't lining up right away, but it almost always corrects in time and matches up.  Overall I'm very impressed how little issues we have, we just need to resync data on occasion.

I think the best thing about Fulcrum is its overall simplicity and layout, as well as frequent feature updates and support. At times this simplicity can be limiting, but the team is pretty good about taking in recommendations, and updates are both regular and useful! Having a specific onboarding team member there by your side during implementation and then a success manager to help with questions after the fact is amazing, and easily the best part of Fulcrum when compared to other MRPs which just leave you to figure it out yourself.

What do you dislike about Fulcrum?
At times, the limitations mentioned before can be a bit of a block. I'd say 80% of businesses that run conventionally will never have issues with Fulcrum, but our particular setup is fairly complex and constantly changes thus leading to some issues that we have to address ourselves.

105857,Fulcrum,https://www.g2.com/products/fulcrum-fulcrum/reviews,4777241,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about Fulcrum?
We have been implementing and using Fulcrum at our manufacturing firm in New Zealand since December 2020. Our company has a headcount of 25, half spread across sales, marketing, engineering and admin, and the remainder as production team members working on the shop floor. We’ve doubled our headcount in the last 12 months, and are looking for tools to help us scale more rapidly. We believe that looking back in 5 years from now, Fulcrum may well be the tool that had the biggest effect on our growth.

The launch team that we were paired with from day one of our implementation were instrumental in our successful launch. We had weekly video calls with them to help us understand the basics, they answered our myriad of questions and they helped us with preparing the data we needed to get Fulcrum live, but it’s also fair to say the implementation did take us a lot longer than first anticipated. A lot of these delays came down to the data set that we had. Our BOM’s were lacking clarity, and the process of getting the data into Fulcrum was not very streamlined. More details about this are in the section below.

We rolled out a staged launch of Fulcrum in our business, with key components being switched over from the outgoing systems over the course of around 6 months. First Inventory management, then Jobs, and then lastly the Job Tracking component that is utilised on the shop floor by our production team members. We also had to complete a full stocktake on the day Job Tracking went live, to ensure the system had all the right information for scheduling.

We are still getting our team completely up and running on Fulcrum’s automated schedule, but once we do, we believe that the superhuman knowledge of the Scheduler understanding every product, sub-component, machine, operation, staff member, inventory level, lead time and many more data points will allow us to scale our manufacturing at a rate not possible via anything else we’ve seen in the market.

What do you dislike about Fulcrum?
We have a good relationship with the key staff at Fulcrum. From their implementation team, right through to their CEO. This is because their company is young, the product is still maturing, and they are experiencing the same growing pains that we are - and so with that, we have a lot of communication with them regarding the product, and the resolution of the problems or questions that we raise.

We believe the core of the product is sound. The Scheduler is the magic sauce, and it works. But the user experience within the product from onboarding right through to day-to-day usage of the system by our team has room for improvement. It is also accurate to say that they *are* improving it. The product has been refined incrementally over the 10 months we have been using it and we hear that the pace of improvement will only increase into the future as they scale up their engineering team.

Regarding the setup process. We have less than 2000 unique item numbers in our company, spread across 10 or so core products. Unfortunately, our previous inventory system kept these as flat BOM’s, so adding the data to tree those products for Fulcrum to understand took us a lot of time. Being based in New Zealand also didn’t help, as we needed a US-based Fulcrum team member to upload our data set each time we had another version to test. Due to the timezone differences, this was usually just a once per day operation whereas if the upload was possible via a user-facing page, we believe we could have been testing uploads multiple times per day. I wouldn’t be surprised if Fulcrum launch their own upload tool in the future just to take that load off their launch teams.

There are a lot of other unique “Fulcrum characteristics” in the platform, that we’re not used to experiencing in other more mature SAAS platforms, but thankfully these are decreasing weekly, and we look forward to the system eventually being simple, clear and robust enough for all our staff to understand and use without too much oversight.

Finally, the lack of quality user documentation due to the rapidly evolving platform also hindered our onboarding timeline as most information was learnt during our weekly meeting. While the meetings were good and I understand the reason behind the lack of docs so far, I was pleased to recently hear that user documentation is high on their priority list.

What problems is Fulcrum solving and how is that benefiting you?
Our end goal for implementing Fulcrum at our company is to help enable rapid, scalable growth. More product out the door, faster and easier than before. We expect we will see that in the future, but because we’re only a few months into what we believe will be a multi-year journey, we’re not yet able to conclude whether this was made possible with Fulcrum.

In the meantime, the process of preparing our data for entry into Fulcrum immediately gave us better quality BOMs. The flow-on effects from that mean better purchasing and inventory management. We also have greater visibility around what the team are completing each day and the real cost of manufacture.

However, the key thing we’re still waiting to see the results from is the Scheduler. Once our production team members start to trust the Scheduler and work on what it asks them to work on, we believe that is when we will start to see efficiencies previously not imagined possible.

I’ll update this review in 6 months with further details around the benefits we are seeing at that point in time. Keep an eye out for it sometime in mid-2022.",4.0,"Name: Andrew H.

When I was working on the Trello  API for creating the bot.First thing I mostly liked that I can test each and every API on the official website with rest API response on it without using any other software for testing the API. Second thing is that It 's faster to respond on the website when we fired any request on it. It's shown instant creation of boards, cards, checklist, organization. Third When we create an organization, We can give customize unique id or name to the organization for future use. This thing I never have seen to other API's integration.
The website is so well organized to identify the changes.
Documentation is well distinguished between the optional or required parameter as well as in category also.
A large number of the feature are available for integration and used for better management. Faster integration with double security provided by Two factors Authentication. I found that Trello can be used in any industry for sharing things on it. (We can share any file of any extension).We can create a to-do list on it and give permission to each user which belongs to a particular board, card, etc.

What do you dislike about Trello Integration?
What I dislike about it? The way of creating a similar Display name of team multiple on it. Users may be confused which would be the correct team in which I belong to use it. Users may be confused to identify the uniqueness of card on the website, If any way to identify the card id or list id on the website it's self. It would be wonderful to the user it APi well.

Recommendations to others considering Trello Integration:
I suppose to give an extended version of Trello in which Api supports the bulk Crue operations. Otherwise it quick good and awesome UI with great handling capability.

What problems is Trello Integration solving and how is that benefiting you?
What I solved from Trello? I made a bot for Trello which can create multiple cards, board, teams, etc. This would be helpful for the industry which is using this application as important for organization management. I can solve the in house problem of sharing things and Daily checklist on it for better visibility to higher authorities.It 's the best way to monitor the work on an employee in any industry.",5.0,"Name: Shubham J.

Spring Labs can completely transform the financial sector by providing a safe, open, and decentralised platform for identity and credit verification.

What do you dislike about Spring Labs?
The adoption of blockchain technology and decentralised solutions by financial institutions and other organisations may be a key factor in determining Spring Labs' performance. As the technology advances and changes, there might also be regulatory challenges to surmount.

Any new technology should be assessed for both its potential advantages and disadvantages, as well as its potential effects on the market and society at large.

What problems is Spring Labs solving and how is that benefiting you?
Spring Labs is working to find a solution for the financial sector's need for secure and dependable identification and credit verification. In conventional systems, this process entails disclosing private and sensitive financial and personal information between various organizations, which can be susceptible to hacking and data breaches.

Blockchain technology is employed by Spring Labs to build a decentralised platform that makes information exchange transparent and safe.

The quality of the produce is top-notch. For most of them, you end up spending 12–14 dollars extra just for delivery + jobs fee which I find quite expensive. I have been a customer for 4 years and each year this fee just increased, the more you order the more the jobs fee is adjusted. So we do buy once a month from Good eggs, but cannot afford it for every single week. In my first year almost every week, I ordered from Goodeggs. We are Indians and do not find everything we eat as staple food here

What do you dislike about Good Eggs?
Things like cake are super expensive, they seem to just have just a few same vendors through these 4 years at least for the cakes. While 95% of the time you find excellent quality of the produce, there are times when your order is missing something or has gone bad, but this happens quite rarely. There was also a time when I really wanted the cake and delivery for my child’s birthday and the driver did not even ring the bell, he took back the delivery and left.

I like the mechanisms it follows to make sure the users, servers etc are prevented from any intruders. The implemetation of the solution was so easy that we didnt even realize when we got the final check call. Before this, we faced some issues with the other solutions that we tried integrating in our system but they somehow failed but this proved us wrong. It gives us a side edge for preventing,protecting from and detecting the threats to endpoints. Its a part of Microsoft Defender, it makes this solution a relaible threat protector for companies like us. It helps us to check the endpoints i.e., the devices our end users or employees use to get into the HQ servers or their regional office servers present in hteir country or in nearby areas. Thus protecting us by onboarding them on to the secure system. It does all this in the real time without us realizing the time taken to do it without relying on the periodic scans. After finding out any vulnerability in the system it takes action automatically and nulifies the effect of that threat. I personally like the microsoft experts who take care of all our problems when whenever we got into one. Also without it, i feel that we would have been in a lot of trouble considering the WFH or remote users in our organisation.

As an intern with only entry-level skills, I found ACE easy to navigate. The software is clearly designed with the user in mind. The design is simple, its functionality is practical, and there is a comprehensive help manual available. ACE also presents the workflow of every user involved in a project, so you can quickly see which documents your coworkers have edited. It also documents what changes were made, so that duplicate edits do not occur.

What do you dislike about ACE?
Unless you are an administrator, changes made to documents in ACE are quite permanent, meaning users need to be careful about what edits they save. (For the sake of document security, it is nice to know that all document changes will be recorded, mistakes and all.)

Recommendations to others considering ACE:
The learning curve for using ACE is relatively small. Spend some time exploring its features. The design is greatly self-explanatory, and there are several resources available to you if you are unsure of where to go.

What problems is ACE solving and how is that benefiting you?
When I used ACE, I was able to view, edit, and save multiple documents in a short amount of time. This made my work exponentially easier when I was cataloging equipment, working on CAPAs, and validating software. The search bar is amazingly versatile. I used it frequently in locating specific documents that would have otherwise required much more time to find on paper.",5.0,"Name: Alexa S.

ACE is a highly customizable system, so that the same function can be used for multiple purposes. Countless ways to customize the workflow makes it very powerful and suitable for plenty of usages.

What do you dislike about ACE?
Since ACE is highly customizable, the user manual could be better explained to help the user understand/create all possibilities.

Recommendations to others considering ACE:
ACE system functions can be used to assemble plenty of workflows for your need. I would recommend talking to an expert from ACE team before starting to scratch the workflow,  just to see what all the options are. so that you can make the system truly yours and meet all the requirements perfectly.

What problems is ACE solving and how is that benefiting you?
ACE was used to track all validation protocols, signatures, and decisions for our team. We also did internal training within ACE system.

ACE is a user friendly, customizable, and cost effective QMS system. It is a versatile software with many applications. We are currently using ACE for document management and plan to use the learning management application in the near term.
The DMS application is intuitive and easy to use. We configured the automated workflows to reflect our internal document review and approval processes. The team of developers at ACE were very helpful and partnered closely with our team to develop, validate, and implement the workflows within a short period of time. Dashboards and reports are easy to create. The system is cloud based and our teams based in the US and China are able to easily access the  application with a modern browser.

What do you dislike about ACE?
ACE is working on enabling the feature that will allow multiple folks to collaborate on documents in real time (e.g. ability for multiple users to edit file simultaneously without worrying about version issues or duplication). Currently we are using a different application for collaborative authoring.

What problems is ACE solving and how is that benefiting you?
ACE has allowed us to transition from a manual mode of document management to an automated system. The manual tracking was resource intensive, increased incidences of versioning errors  which impacted document quality and led to confusion, frustration and loss of time. The DMS has automated workflows to streamline review and approval processes. The workflows send email reminders and notifications to remind folks of upcoming actions and deadlines. It tracks all changes to version history, version control, and furnishing full audit trail of changes to the documents.",4.5,"Name: Debjani D.

It would be nice if ACE includes all analytical data submission and analytical records.

As with any electronic QS element, there is a front-end task of establishing and training at a site level. Not sure much can be done about that.

MEDDIC Academy and Darius were instrumental helping us to deploy the MEDDPICC Sales methodology. We were given an Enterprise access to the full MEDDIC bundle course online a few weeks prior to  our annual Sales Kickoff (aka SKO). That course by itself was sharp, concise, to the point and possibly enough for some self-motivated sales people. We then had Darius Lahoutifard speaking during our SKO with a highlight of what we had learned online in a more personal and interactive way, followed by an amazing workshop. The workshop not only helped to practice MEDDPICC, but also helped us know ourselves better. Something we had never done internally such as reflecting and analyzing our true unique differentiators. Our sales managers had some additional training and we were already speaking the MEDDPICC language immediately after the training.

What do you like best about MEDDIC Sales Training?
The fact that Darius has a long experience in Enterprise Sales and Sales Leadership made his pitch extremely practical, real, trust worthy and credible.

Their eLearning platform is easy to use and the lessons are sharp, short, to the point.

We also wanted to offer four types of payment options, and we were able to do that. We offerered to pay by check, Zelle, PayPal, and Stripe. The Stipe function was integrated into the form and was along with Zelle the most popular.
We also wanted to be able to visually customize the form, both the background image, the font, and other features and that was all available. It is even possible to insert videos and images into the form.
We also wanted to catch everyone's information regardless if they would complete the form or not. MightyForms capture both completed and abandoned entries. We would then use both of those for our communications about the event.",5.0,"Name: Didrik S B.

It looks great, and it's so easy to build forms. Drag, drop, configure - it's probably one of the easiest form builders I've used to date.

One particularly useful feature is the ability to create Stripe-linked product and service purchase forms without code and being able to keep it styled like the form. So many DIY checkout options end up looking terrible.

What do you dislike about MightyForms?
Hard to pinpoint anything really. The only thing really is the click+drag method for creating multiple columns in a form is a little clunky. It might be easier to with a simple approach  - a settings popup where you can say how many columns you want and it takes care of positioning for it.

Recommendations to others considering MightyForms:
Dive in and start building forms, it's quite easy. And, if you need help, or have feature ideas you want to discuss, reach out to the team. They are super friendly and very proactive. It's clear, as new players in this industry, they want to build the best product.

123882,MightyForms,https://www.g2.com/products/mightyforms/reviews,4589188,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about MightyForms?
- Detailed statistics were a big plus in our decision to try out MightyForms. This is incredibly helpful for our use case where we are conducting a time in motion study to see how our form is performing.
- The design of the form itself is nice and the UI is okay.
- The file upload function is well thought-out with loading indicators.
- Ability to ""add more"" (eg add more files in a file upload, add more list items) is rare among form builders but MightyForms has it
- Integrations with webhooks, Google Drive, and Dropbox enable automation and proper file handling

What do you dislike about MightyForms?
- While the UI is visually appealing, there are some tiny bugs that derail the entire experience
- Hard to preview (and thus formulate) logic jumps. Sometimes it works on the preview, other times it won't. Only way to know for sure is to publish the form and view it live, which would then skew/impact statistics.
- Handling of uploaded files could be better. Big concern is filename collision: there is no unique identifier prepended/appended to the file before uploading to Google Drive or Dropbox. On Google Drive this may not be that much of a problem, but on Dropbox this is a major problem as I have observed the file upload will outright fail. Would be ideal if the file submissions are organized into folders by submission instead of just being dumped into the folder — for our use case, we request multiple files, so I might have to write a script to do that just to fix these issues.

The price of entry can't be beaten, as Apache ActiveMQ Artemis is an open-source solution that can be deployed and used in production without licensing fees. In this case, you get what you don't pay for, as Artemis is a stable, high-quality, and high-performance JMS messaging platform.

What do you dislike about Artemis?
Understanding the clustering and failover options and what best suited the constraints of our deployment was quite tricky. Although there is good and quite comprehensive user documentation available for free for Artemis, it does not cover the implications of one option over another for clustering and failover. This meant we had to experiment with the options available before ending up with a solution that suited us that was also functional from an automatic failover perspective.

What problems is Artemis solving and how is that benefiting you?
We deployed Apache ActiveMQ Artemis in our development, test, and production environments, comprised of a pair of active/passive clustered servers per environment that provide high availability and automatic failover.

We use Artemis to integrate several real-time operational planning and execution systems, using asynchronous message publish and subscribe patterns for this integration.

126030,Shogun,https://www.g2.com/products/shogun-shogun/reviews,9558709,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about Shogun?
First and foremost the support at Shogun is probably the best I have ever experienced.  Not only do they have live agents, but they are fantastically helpful and nice and go out of their way to help you with your question or problem.  Never have they been dismissive or condescending around something I have asked or need help with.  And they help you RIGHT AWAY.  You don't have to wait three days for an answer.  So I love the support.  But as for the app itself - I use it in conjunction with Shopify and it gives me everything I need.  I create all of my marketing and landing pages with Shogun because it is easy to add functional objects and layouts to a page where I can then customize it to my heart's content.  The UI is VERY easy to use.  Shogun is one of those products that is a pleasure to use, and which I get excited to use. Also, the team behind Shogun is constantly updating its features and holding webinars about those features.  It makes you feel like they will be around for a while, and that they really care about the product and not just about the subscription fee.

What do you dislike about Shogun?
The higher tiers of the subscription is... costly.  I work for a VERY small company and I wish some of the features would be available at the lower tier (like global snippets).  I wish it was more on a per/seat license or for size of a company.  I don't want to have to pay double or triple for some features I feel should come standard. Not the end of the world.  Shogun is worth every penny, especially if you use it a lot.  Last, while they do add quite a bit of new features, I wouldn't mind them refining/updating some of the older ones (like the ability to add different hero slideshows and/or navigations for it).   Again, small stuff.  This is a great product!

What problems is Shogun solving and how is that benefiting you?
I've been in the creative industry for over 25+ years.  I used to do all of the coding for web sites - I'm older now and don't want to do that so Shogun offers me a way to take a lot of the coding stuff out of my hands and makes it easy to just customize the objects and functionality.  So it saves me a LOT OF TIME as I create new or update landing pages.",5.0,"Name: Tony F.

Shogun is the best way to create a landing page, especially in BigCommerce - but the best part is the customer service. There is always someone there to help you less than 1 minute of asking a question. Not only that, but they make screenshares and walk you through how to best solve your problem - and provide multiple ways to go about it. They truly understand their product & their customers!

What do you dislike about Shogun?
Sometimes it can be tricky to deal with margins and padding, but I wouldnt change anything about it. I like that those options provide customization options to the millimeter, which makes my job much easier.

Allows me to actually create a well-designed landing page. The best part is that I can customize everything to my liking so that I can then focus on the content.

I think that some of the terminology could be better explained, because as someone without web design experience it is difficult to know when I should use margins vs padding or % vs px, etc.

I think it can do a lot than I am aware of, but each time I use it I learn something new.

There is a few small things that make integration into an exisiting theme's design a little challenging. Specific sections that are made by the theme might not be able to be replicated. And previewing your sections when upgrading themes is a roadbump. Nothing that can't be overcome with some basic code. Would really like the ability to schedule page versions based on manually saved versions, vs autosaved versions. Easy to use overall though.

At our institution, before we implemented MDClone, researchers and other consumers of clinical data were dependent on mediators with technical expertise and access to various databases. This created a bottleneck that limited the speed and flexibility of projects dependent on data. Obtaining IRB approval also delayed many projects.
With MDClone, any end user can access clinical data according to permissions. Even before obtaining IRB approval reseachers can access synthetic data, which is statistically almost identical to the original data. This early access allows users to assess the feasibility of their proposed project by understanding both the availability and quantity of the desired data. In many cases users can perform analyses and reach insights based on synthetic data alone. (Synthetic data can also be shared freely outside our organizationn). When original data is required and IRB approval is obtained, researchers work efficiently by re-running the queries built previously. All of this is done independently, without the need for mediators.
The improvement in efficiency and flexibility can be compared to writing an email as opposed to sending a letter by post.

What do you dislike about MDClone?
MDClone is a powerful tool that enables end-users to access the data they need. But some training is required, and proficiency is gained through experience. I see this as inevitable and not a drawback of the system itself, but the effort required by the end-user is not negligible.  Obviously more complex queries will require more effort.

- Support of many languages.

What do you dislike about WeStrive?
Well that is the thing. The only thing that holded me back was Language of Dutch ( which wasn't part of the app at that time ) as the payment option in the future of a natively supported payment provide in The Netherlands.

I reached out to WeStrive and Corry came back to me. Both were agreed upon to implement. I joined and he and I teamed up for the implementation of the Dutch Language. Ideal is also a GO when needed.

So there is nothing. What I like to point out is, they think with you as a Trainer and no empty words or promises. A+++.

I wish the Glue could tie directly to your Google drive and allow presentations or documents that you have in your drive be presented without them having to be saved and copied up to the shared team files in a different format. Right now, you CAN connect to google drive, but if you go to slides you can see the slide, but you can't present it.

My feedback is that with the new ""Sign"" update, first time users might be wondering how to add other users to sign. The other thing would be the number of emails received when someone opens, followed by after they signed the documents.

Signaturely takes care of all my document signing operations.

I love how Signaturely makes both my regular and less-than-regular operations easy. If there's a standard document I use over and over, I can easily create a template to make that task go faster. If I want to hook into an automator like Zapier or Pabbly, it can do that to. If I have lots of documents, it offers an API.

On the other hand, if there's a one-off document I need to sign, or that someone without digital signature capabilities needs me to sign, they I just upload the document, mark the fields, and DONE!

Signaturely nails the user experience with its straightforward interface and rapid functionality. Getting documents signed is quick and hassle-free, saving me time.

Folders with permission are great and organizing documents neatly and managing who can access them adds a layer of security and control that I find indispensable.

Creating templates for frequently signed documents is a godsend. It ensures consistency and shaves off the effort needed for repetitive signings.

What do you dislike about Signaturely?
The only notable drawback I've encountered while using Signaturely is the absence of an in-platform document editor. While the platform excels at facilitating electronic signatures, it falls short when it comes to making quick edits to documents. In instances where I need to make edits, I find myself having to exit the platform and later recreate the document upload process from scratch, which can be quite inconvenient. Integrating an editing feature within the platform would probably enhance the overall user experience.

To become a customer-obsessed company needed more actionable NPS information, and we needed the “whys” behind the score.  We were looking for a product that would automate the processes we needed to keep in touch with customers a lot of customers in a timely manner.

We had outgrown SurveyMonkey. We looked at Qualtrics and Medallia along with Alchemer. We decided that neither Qualtrics nor Medallia would be a good fit for us.  Too complex, too time-intensive.

We needed something now, not in 18 months. We needed to have the data from the Alchemer platform easily handed back to our already established systems.  A lean, easy, cost-effective, and agile solution is what we needed.   When I’m told a product is easy and fast to implement – I usually roll my eyes and think - oh sure.

I worked with the Peak Support team for nearly 2 years handling our member service needs and project management. They handled thousands of inquiries from our members, and helped make sure I had the data and resources available to make smart decisions. Every 2 weeks they prepared a detailed report showing our response times, CSAT scores, volume and any red flags. It was immensely helpful to have this. Their commitment and accountability made for a great partnership.

What do you like best about Peak Support?
I think any team could be trained to follow a series of steps. Where Peak Support really excelled was in thinking a step further ahead, proposing solutions, and raising a flag to me when something needed my attention. They genuinely cared about keeping our members happy, finding smart solutions and exceeding expectations. I really appreciated how the leadership team would be direct with me if they felt I was making a decision that could have negative repercussions on our service. They were true partners. The team leaders are great critical thinkers and know how to move team members around to achieve outcomes.

I love how CryptoView makes it easy to act as a one stop shop for a portfolio management solution that connects across all of my existing exchange and trading accounts in crypto. This makes it easier to manage my portfolio, see all of my positions and assets, and generally stay on top of my portfolio performance.

What do you dislike about CryptoView.com?

The best thing I liked about cryptoview is that they have a easy and detailed interface which anyone can use,even if he/she is a beginner in the crypto world.Very less platforms can compete with cryptoview in terms of tracking and comparing the cryptos on various indicators which greatly helps to track performance of our investments.

What do you dislike about CryptoView.com?
The main reason why I switched to BitcoLoan is that although they have very good interface and great tracking system but their customer support needs to improve.

We liked the ablity to be able to create interavtice forms, however the secuirty risks the forms carried was concernging. Heyflow does interactive forms well, but needs to iron out the secuirty issues.

What do you dislike about Heyflow?
When I signed up for Heyflow services on their website, the site stated that the site featured “data security and privacy” which can be found at their site: https://heyflow.com/features/data-security/.  However, after I signed up and created a portal and the software was not able to work because it was Blacklisted. I was not able to use the software since large security online sites like Sucuri.com and PhisTank blacklisted their company portal. The company did not deliver on the security aspect that was stated when I signed up. The portal is still blacklisted and gives security warnings. I can't risk my clients customers being a risk for a phising attempt.

Terrible experience as their customer service handled this issue very poorly. I was on a trial which then paid for 1 month. After alerting the company of the security issues they said I didnt meet the criteria for a refund. I was disappointed they wanted me to risk my clients data. Please be very careful when considering HeyFlow fr your company or client.

Messente is a platform that provides our customers with SMS Verification codes and order tracking links. It's very user-friendly, and it's easy to implement for tech support peeps. Although we didn't integrate it with other platforms, I still believe that it's possible. As we have a lot of requests from customers, we use this tool every day, and if we have some troubles - Customer Support or the Account manager will help us. They always provide us with information regarding suspicious activity and ask if it's need to deactivate some of the country codes from SMS receiving in order to save our cost.

What do you dislike about Messente?
Cost is one of the main problems, as it's really expensive to send SMS messages, especially if your business includes sending large volumes of SMS like ours. There is also an issue with mobile networks. SMS messages sent through Messente are reliant on the recipient's mobile network and device. This can result in potential delivery issues, delays, or failed message deliveries, especially in areas with weak or unreliable mobile network coverage.

What problems is Messente solving and how is that benefiting you?
It makes the system of SMS sendings ease and makes it automatic. Also, it's a good tool for fraud prevention, as Messente's employees will contact you if they see suspicious traffic from X country and are able to limit SMS sent to that country code until this traffic ends.",5.0,"Name: Mursal A.

I can plan out my days in office and share my intentions with colleagues very easily. This way everyone knows who will be in on which days which helps for meeting planning or huddles that may be better in person.

I wish it were a bit easier to schedule both in the office and out of the office from the scheduling page. Today, you need to plan the date in office, and then opt-out to make it clear that you won't be in versus a blank day which appears like you haven't submitted your availability yet.

Airbyte has proven to be an absolute game-changer in the realm of data management, solidifying its position as the best tool ever known for moving data. Its extensive range of features and functionalities makes it an unparalleled choice for any company in search of a robust and reliable ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) solution.

One of Airbyte's most impressive features is its vast array of connectors. With over 200 ready-to-use connectors, this tool can seamlessly integrate with a wide variety of systems and data sources. From databases to cloud services and third-party applications, Airbyte offers a broad range of connection options, simplifying the data extraction process.

The Command Line Interface (CLI) integration and compatibility with task orchestrators further streamline the configuration and monitoring of connectors and connections. Airbyte's versatility is evident in its ability to work seamlessly with orchestration tools, enabling more efficient management and seamless automation.

Reliability is a cornerstone of Airbyte. Its capability to manage connections and connectors with Terraform provides administrators with peace of mind, allowing for predictable and consistent tool deployment and configuration. The ability to carry out deployments with Helm and Terraform significantly simplifies the onboarding process.

What do you dislike about Airbyte?
However, Airbyte is not without its imperfections. One notable limitation worth mentioning is the inability to configure pod resources in the open-source version of Airbyte via the web interface. For some organizations, this may be a drawback, although future updates are expected to address this issue.

What problems is Airbyte solving and how is that benefiting you?
Airbyte excels in solving one of the most pressing issues in data management: the extraction and consolidation of information from multiple sources. With this tool, we've successfully extracted data from sales systems, CRMs, administrative platforms, and accounting systems spanning more than 27 countries. This has allowed us to generate valuable insights for our company and our managers.

Airbyte has greatly simplified the task of centralizing and normalizing data scattered across various systems, a process that was previously labor-intensive and error-prone. By consolidating and harmonizing this data, we've gained a clearer and unified view of our operations worldwide, significantly improving our decision-making and our ability to identify opportunities and challenges.

In summary, Airbyte has become a cornerstone of our data management strategy, enabling us to harness the full potential of our data and providing tangible benefits in terms of efficiency, visibility, and informed decision-making. This tool has proven to be a true gem in the world of data management, and we can't wait to see how it continues to evolve to meet our ever-changing needs.",5.0,"Name: Claudio Francisco V.

Airbyte's connection to BigQuery simplifies the process of moving and transforming data into Google's cloud-based data warehouse. This feature allows users to easily set up data pipelines, transferring information from different sources, making necessary changes, and then loading it into BigQuery for analysis and reporting.

This integration significantly reduces the manual work and complexities usually involved in moving and organizing data for analysis in BigQuery. It makes the process more straightforward, enabling users to focus on analyzing the data rather than spending time on the technical aspects of data integration.

By providing a reliable and dedicated connector for BigQuery, Airbyte helps users leverage the capabilities of Google's data warehouse more efficiently and effectively, facilitating smoother data management and analysis.

having data from external services in a data warehouse is a standard issue for a lot of companies and for some reason there isn't a single quick way to sort it out.

we chose the open source version of airbyte primarily for the alpha connectors (unavailable in the managed version) and because we're able to deploy it on our k8s clusters and ""the backend and data team"" (literally two people) work closely together.

deployment and general reliability are very straightforward, and once a connector is set up and starts syncing, it just works.

What do you dislike about Airbyte?
many of the connectors are in alpha state and one is generally forced to switch to the open source version if one of those is needed. a few connectors prioritise snowflake compatibility over bigquery (there are a few issues concerning the handling of dates), but everything being open source, it's straightforward to deploy your own patched version.

Having all our connectors in one place is incredibly helpful, and having such a vast amount of connectors at our fingertips saves us time from creating these things from scratch.

We manage airbyte on our own hosted EC2, so there is a fair amount of time associated with maintaining that and getting it set up with a proper CI/CD pipeline.

I do wish that incremental loads allows for a lookback window (i.e. load everything from the latest date minus 15 minutes onward) to help them be more reliable.

We've been with Airbyte for 18 months now and at the time of adopting the product, their long tail on the amount of connectors as well as their consumption-based pricing made them not only the best product for our company but also the by far the most cost-effective. Fast forward to today and they continue to rapidly evolve the product and add even more connectors to the offering.

Their set-up wizard makes it incredible easy to set-up a new pipeline in minutes. With the added ability to have syncs run on pre-defined schedules or cron expressions as well as webhooks to push failures notifications directly to Slack, we feel very comfortable with the set-it and forget-it mentality and can be easily notified if something comes up.

Azure Front Door speeded up our web access to public portals and websites. It checks network traffic before entering Azure. SSL offloading and abnormal traffic detection are possible.

We tested a few CDNs and Azure Front Door; Front Door was cheaper to set up and maintain and had all the needed features.

Microsoft needs to clarify what each of its products—Traffic Manager, Application Gateway, and Azure Front Door—does.

There are several aspects to appreciate about SubQuery:

It addresses this challenge by distributing query execution across multiple nodes, enabling parallel processing.

AWS is a nice environment, and very configurable, but the experience with MS SQL Server is not good enough. The management of resources and scale are simple, practical and intuitive (although it lack some triggers on AWS side to not scale the cost too quickly)

What do you dislike about Microsoft SQL Server 2016 Web on Windows Server 2019?
Dealing with MS SQL Server is a true nightmare. It's pretty at the beginning, but it doesn't scale with a better performance than free alternatives such as MariaDB, and the integration with NoSQL tools (Neo4J and MongoDB) is too bureaucratic and non intuitive. I'd just recommend SQL Server if there's too much work in transfering the environment to other DBMS.

What problems is Microsoft SQL Server 2016 Web on Windows Server 2019 solving and how is that benefiting you?
I had a system already running on SQL Server that needed to be moved to cloud (due to storage costs not scaling fast enough). The primary usage was to get information for data prediction, which I had to model in NoSQL environments, and migrating it to MariaDB wasn't a viable alternative. The queries to connect SQL Server to our environment, however, were terrible. I found no benefits other than not migrating the entire DB to another DBMS.",2.0,"Name: NOT GIVEN

155622,Threater,https://www.g2.com/products/threater/reviews,7621480,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about Threater?
We've been using Threatblockr for over five years, which has met all our cybersecurity needs. We are incredibly pleased with its performance. The software is easy to use and navigate. It has proven to be very effective in protecting our devices and personal information from potential threats by blocking all non-domestic traffic and all the threat lists we subscribe to. One of the features I appreciate the most is the real-time blocking and the ability to view the logs in real-time. The customer support team has also been very helpful in answering any questions we have had. I highly recommend Threatblockr to anyone looking for reliable and user-friendly cybersecurity solutions to simply block malicious traffic.

What do you dislike about Threater?
A few things that I would recommend is to be able to drill down in more detail on the specific traffic that is being allowed and blocked. It would be nice to have a more interactive dashboard to try and see what IPs are doing with particular features (i.e., Blocked by Reason, Blocked by Category, Blocked by Country, and Blocked by ASN). It would be beneficial to look into this data to identify the traffic without looking at the exported logs.

What problems is Threater solving and how is that benefiting you?
The problems that ThreatBlockr is solving is by blocking all non-domestic traffic that we, as our domestic bank, does not do business with, and with any threat lists that is out there that are indeed malicious to avoid traffic to our network devices (i.e., firewalls, web filtering)",5.0,"Name: NOT GIVEN

155622,Threater,https://www.g2.com/products/threater/reviews,7761150,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about Threater?
The ability to ingest, aggregate, and take action based on different threat reputation and open-source feeds using STIX/TAXII and web .txt URLs.

This is something only a combination of SIEM/SOAR/UTM/TIP solutions could do.

Often this combination focuses on enrichment and IOC hunting, but it was difficult to ever take this information and compile it into a meaningful reputation block list that an NGFW could then ingest and take action with.

What do you dislike about Threater?
Centralized logging of the different appliances' web activities such as their blocking behavior requires a SIEM or centralized Syslog server.

It doesn't allow for centralized searching of these logs via the SaaS portal.

What problems is Threater solving and how is that benefiting you?
Solved holes in NGFW reputation-based blocks and is easier to administrate and troubleshoot activity than most NGFWs.

Allowed us to pull in different paid and open-source STIX/TAXII and URL-based reputation sources and create our own block lists which is much more complex and difficult to achieve when combining SIEM/SOAR/UTM/TIP/NGFW technology stacks.

Geo-Blocking is probably the best on the market and we prefer it heavily over similar NGFW functionality.

155622,Threater,https://www.g2.com/products/threater/reviews,7615537,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about Threater?
We've had a ThreatBlockr device ever since I arrived at my organization almost 7 years ago. It was brought in by my now senior manager and I would never deploy another site without one.

This appliance allows such an easy way to do geoblocking, it is incredible, point, click, save. Need to see if the country is blocked? No problem just type it in.
Allows me with pinpoint accuracy to adjust what I want in and out of my network before it even gets to my firewall with simple sliders. I get full control over how much risk I want to take with which ASNs. Need to allow some ASN traffic but want to make sure a slight deviation in the threat score blocks it? No problem, you adjust the slider from 0 to 100 or -100.
Solid insights on threat levels of malicious IPs/Websites.
Whitelist/Blacklisting lists are super simple to use.
Plus ThreatBlockr has a ton of out-of-the-box content lists you can link to.
I've also dabbled in having a dynamic list linked to a Google doc that I can update an IP or Website I want blocked into the Google doc and it transverses to the policy seamlessly.
With the GMC portal I can get single pane of glass review of both my devices across both our ISPs in front of our HA'd firewalls.
Support is top-notch as well, which is great, but I've rarely had to use it.
Updating is a breeze!

What do you dislike about Threater?
My biggest gripe is when the Threatblockr is restricting a site, there is no splash page like OpenDNS/Umbrella. Also if Im Geoblocking a certain country and the website is coming from there and I run a search inside the GMC, it won't tell me if it is in a blocked country or not, kind of slows me down.

Otherwise the interface is rock solid.

What problems is Threater solving and how is that benefiting you?

The appliances are effortless to deploy, configure, and maintain. We can quickly look up log data on each device individually when we suspect something may be getting blocked. Their reports clearly illustrate the importance of the service to leadership. Using ThreatBlockr appliances between our UTMs and our WAN connections have allowed us to offload much of the load that our UTMs would have needed to process if they were connected directly to the Internet.

What do you dislike about Threater?
Sometimes, the threat lists block shared webserver IPs, resulting in false positive blocking of legitimate websites. Because of where we position the appliances in our topology, I can't easily see what specific hosts on our internal network are trying to access so we often have to compare ThreatBlockr logs to UTM logs to get the full picture.

While your SIEM may alert you of threats, Threatblockr allows you to retrieve threat intel from TAXII/STIX feeds and blocks it.  Most firewalls do not work with threat feeds unless they are URL-based.  Threatblockr is one of the few devices that will pull in feeds so that you can block near real-time threats.  They also include a premium threat feed from Webroot at no additional cost.

What do you dislike about Threater?
There are two managment interfaces, a local one and a cloud-based site.  Initially, it gets a little confusing on which site handles configuration and interface changes.  Reporting needs work.  There isn't a way to run on-demand reports.  You have to schedule reports in advance (monthly will run on the 1st of every month, weekly runs at midnight on Sunday, etc.) .

156498,Titan,https://www.g2.com/products/titan-titan/reviews,9531409,NOT GIVEN,"What do you like best about Titan?
I don't find much to like about Titan. It's a step up from Compuserve email, which I was using in the 1990s, but a step down when compared to Outlook, Gmail, Thunderbird, and any other email client I've used since.

What do you dislike about Titan?
Buggy, terrible spam filter that stuffs good mail into spam, span into my Inbox, ignores some of its own filters,  and can't be adjusted or turned off.  This alone wastes 10-15 minutes a day doing things my email client would do automatically if I could turn the filter off. Frequently needs to be resynced to show current email. Frequently fails to show the ""spam"" button, delete spam when asked to, and mark emails as read when asked to. There's nothing I like about this product, which is a rare response for me.

I'm bewildered by the positive reviews here. If I had to option to switch to something else, I would in a microsecond, but unfortunately my hosting provide tied itself to Titan, as incorrectly named a product as any I've encountered, and I'm stuck with it for four years.

I love how straight-forward and easy it is to use. It doesn't shove all these fancy features in your face (although it does have a few fancy features which I don't normally use) and does the basics right.

This is a feature that's super useful to have as a small business.

I chose Titan after reviewing many other providers. I had been using the same provider that I bought my domain from for almost 20 years. Then - suddenly - two years of email history disappeared. They were unresponsive but I put off moving until my emails started bouncing from known contacts - one of their servers had been identified as a spammer. I did a lot of research and Titan had the features I needed at a reasonable price. It seemed the best match at the time. Once on, I found it pretty easy to navigate and the customer service is second to none.

What do you dislike about Titan?
While I have had no problems, my wife, under the same domail name is the target of spammers that did not appear until we swtched to Titan. She receives between 50 and 100 per day. While most of them go to her spam folder, Titan seems to be powerless to stop them. We both use Thunderbird email as our client and while we can pretty easily access our email when traveling, the Titan browser it not as intuitive or flexible as T-bird.

I have found Titan's customer service very responsive to customer needs. There are some things Titan does that other email services do not, and the best way to find out what's going on is to contact them!  I appreciate a company that will help me with an issue professionally, warmly, and friendly. Titan is that.

What do you dislike about Titan?
Some of the work I do is classified for confidentiality. Titan does not seem to have the means to file those emails and their replies into a locked folder. It threatens the promised confidentiality; I may have to give up the email account to maintain that confidentiality. I would dislike that intensely.

What problems is Titan solving and how is that benefiting you?
I needed an email separate from my private life to communicate with those involved in my research. It is a big reason, the only reason, for the confidentiality. So far, Titan has provided me with that email server. Thank you. Now I need Titan to provide a way to password protect the emails to/from participants, so that their confidentiality can be further assured.",4.0,"Name: Denise A K.

In my experience with online service providers, when I ask for something I know they can do, but they have not done before, it takes weeks to get an answer, with Titan I get response quickly and never need to fight over getting data they have but do not normally provide.  Its the same with new feature requests.  This is great.

What do you dislike about Titan?
I do have a struggle understanding how to make all of the website work.  the directions for specific items is vauge at times and even now, after two months, I have not had time to sit down and learn how to do what I am sure is a simple switch somewhere in the app.

What problems is Titan solving and how is that benefiting you?

Great user interface, easy to use, but it's the support team that makes this a great platform choice, Any time I've dealt with them since signing up with Titan, they go out of their way to make sure whatever it is that needs to be sorted, gets done.

I like that Valkyrie supplies templates for users to build off of and change to their liking. It makes it easier to not be lost when starting a new project. I also really like the range of uses, it can be used for anything from video games to real estate or educational purposes. I also like the layout of the software. I am able to adjust it and move the different sections around to my liking. It is very helpful that when I hover the mouse over a function, a little description of what it does pops up. This is a nice reminder about what everything does as I am not quite that proficient yet.

What do you dislike about Valkyrie No-Code Creative Platform?
When I started using this software, I did not have a mouse. I found that I was not able to complete all the functions that I wanted to with ease. I have difficulty moving around a scene. I later purchased a mouse just so that I was able to properly use the software. I also have minimal expericence with using CAD like softwares. With minimal experience I found it quite challenging to learn how to use and become semi-proficient. For me, it was knowing how to put entities, action and events together to make it do what I wanted it to do that I found challenging. Knowing which combination of actions and events would do what, and what order to put them in. Unless I was explicetly shown how to do something I had trouble with this.

What problems is Valkyrie No-Code Creative Platform solving and how is that benefiting you?
The main benefit that I have realised about Valkyrie is, as I mentioned before, its versatility. Valkyrie can be used for practicaly anything, though there may not be a need for it. When I was using Valkyrie I was mainly experimenting and learning how to use it. But the projects that I have done where to do with displaying and showing the function of a product as well as displaying it. For example, the telsa template. I did not make it, but I spend time learning how to change and adapt it, they used this knowlegde to change the template in to a shoe customiser.",3.5,"Name: NOT GIVEN

We were on the lookout for something that could make setting up DNS less of a maze, especially for those who aren't super tech savvy. It was super easy our internal team to implement, and even easier for our users to connect their domains to Vev. The interface is so user-friendly; even my grandma could probably do it.

What do you dislike about Entri?
Due to our customer base, it'd be beneficial if they had more Nordic DNS providers on their list.

What problems is Entri solving and how is that benefiting you?
Entri addresses a significant challenge we faced in streamlining the DNS setup process, making it more efficient and user-friendly for our clients connecting with Vev. Traditionally, configuring DNS involved a cumbersome and complex procedure, particularly for users less versed in DNS intricacies. This often necessitated leaving our platform and engaging with various stakeholders to ensure a successful setup.

Entri has notably transformed this experience. Now, the entire process takes place within a modal, eliminating the need for users to exit our platform when configuring their DNS. This streamlined approach significantly enhances user convenience and expedites the overall setup timeline.

Moreover, Entri's feature allowing the generation of a sharable link in case users lack DNS login credentials is particularly advantageous.

Nothing really. Any issues I have had have been resolved quickly with the Entri team.

Asking users to manually enter DNS records is the *worst* — it's literally never a good experience for anyone.

Then Entri came along and made it feel like magic for our end users. The whole experience feels like Plaid, except for DNS, and it makes it so so so easy for our users (who tend to be less-technical) to put their creations on the internet.

Beyond that, integration was simple easy, it's never felt buggy, and their support & documentation is top-notch. In the rare instance where we've had a question or hiccup, their response time has been quite fast.

What do you dislike about Entri?
Nothing major. If we're being *really* picky, I wish the UX around handling subdomains was a tad cleaner (although subdomains are rare for us). To their credit though, we've communicated this to the team, and they've been incredibly receptive — and incredibly responsive to feedback in general.

What problems is Entri solving and how is that benefiting you?
Asking our users to enter DNS records in Google Domains, GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc is incredibly annoying for them.

WelcomeSpaces is a very convenient way to connect with financial experts. I can search for professionals, connect with them via instant messaging, and join a private space to work together, all from the comfort of my own home.

The platform is designed and limited to finding financial professionals in certain countries. If you are not from those countries, you may still find someone who can help you, but their niche market is for those specific countries.

The platform ensures that emails are delivered to the intended recipient's inbox, reducing the likelihood of emails getting marked as spam which increases deliverability rates.
The platform's dashboard provides very good insights and analytics to help users track the success of their email campaigns in an easy-to-use interface.
Autoresponders, drip campaigns, and list segmentation are very nice automation features.
The ability for users to customize emails to match their brand's style and strategy is simple using a wide choice of pre-designed templates, in addition to being able to create custom templates.

What do you dislike about JetSend?
JetSend's limited integration with third-party tools and platforms can be a major disadvantage for businesses that rely on multiple tools to manage their email campaigns.
No Free Plan which may deter small businesses and startups from using the platform.
Customer support is limited to email and live chat support, which may not be sufficient for businesses that require immediate assistance.
The pricing structure is based on the number of emails sent per month, which can be expensive for businesses that send a large volume of emails.

What problems is JetSend solving and how is that benefiting you?

One of the best things about Sparkle is that you don't need any knowledge of HTML or CSS.

We used to struggle with keeping track of all the assets and equipment in our facility.

The title says it all. We deal with financial services customers and hence a lot of sensitive PII data is being interracted with.

Accuracy and ease of use is also very important to us. There are lots of DLP tools out there on the market but no one is as accurate like Strac. Their machine learning model picks up any kind of attachment/image that may contain sensitive data. I was hesistatnt to sign up at first, yet after seeing how the software works, I was convinced it is the right tool to use for DLP. Set-up was easy and we had (and continue to have) hands-on support.

We collect our customer’s sensitive personal data to offer financial tools. One of our products is 'Joint Cards' where we issue 2 cards for 1 joint account. We leverage Strac's tokenization & interceptor solution so that we don't have to worry touching sensitive SSNs and can leverage Strac's security expertise in building hundreds of security controls.

We could also detect identity fraud using Strac's unique tokenization solution which we are really happy with. That saved us a ton of financial losses and headaches. We are looking forward to integrating with various other Strac solutions deep into our tech stack.

What do you dislike about Strac?
It's been more challenging to sell the idea of why we should be using security solutions like Strac offers to management and stakeholders as the value is not typically seen right away - it's seen and measured when potential loss happens or there's been a data breach.

The Text Generator Plugin has won my heart; no longer am I the one-man-source of my own mind. To be frank, it has become my trusted brainstorming buddy.

Recommendations to others considering Embarque:
I would suggest more minutes to test the new features like automated dubbing and a way to proofread the subtitles generated from one language to another without using our monthly minutes so we don't end up wasting our minutes on something we won't be able to use in the end.

Whether tweaking content for a design project or modifying text for business purposes, Copyflow.ai integrates into users' routines smoothly, becoming a reliable companion in their digital endeavors. Implementing Copyflow.ai into my routine was a cakewalk. No complex setup procedures or tech headaches – just a quick and easy integration. Till now I didn't need customer support.

What do you dislike about CopyFlow.ai?
When I landed on CopyFlow It didn't look to me like a professional or something amazing that's because of the design of the interface. As of being a designer, I know what a design should look like. But honestly, the design is not as good as other modern websites like other AI tools websites. So I think the design should be improved. And the second thing I was saying there was a problem when I was converting the text for my portfolio website was when I wanted the text for my website I didn't want it in points so there should be an option to tell where you want to use the text, I think that will take Copyflow towards more growth and popular.
