Today malware is diverse and numerous. Thousands of potential spyware, Trojans, keyloggers and spybots endanger the safety of your private and business information. The constant development of malware techniques makes traditional signature-based systems quite ineffective in detecting new and emerging threats. The innovative solution by Neuber Software - Network Security Task Manager - is an must-have for proper Windows network protection. Network Security Task Manager is based on behavior and code analysis. It protects Windows networks from industrial espionage, sabotage and security-critical software, informing you about active malware on networked computers in real time mode. This compact and fast tool analyzes Windows processes running on networked computers and shows a unique security risk rating for each process. Besides, Network Security Task Manager displays full directory path and file name of a certain process, its description and manufacturer, computers the process runs on and embedded hidden functions, such as keyboard monitoring or browser supervision. It should be noted that Network Security Task Manager stands out from other behavior-based programs. Apart from providing an easy overview about running processes on networked computers it has some major advantages over similar tools. Network Security Task Manager needs no installation, no setup, and no updates. The user license is unlimited, and after a single payment no additional subscription fees are imposed. The price is reasonable and depends on the number of computers that are monitored. The price of unlimited user license depends on the number of computers monitored, e.g. 20 USD per client for 5 clients or 8 USD per client for 100 clients.

The company recognizes that many individuals and businesses today are struggling to keep up with the demands of a fast-paced and ever-changing world, and are often bogged down by unproductive and time-consuming tasks that prevent them from focusing on what really matters.

To address this challenge, Bottleneck offers a suite of services designed to relieve clients of unproductive tasks and help them optimize their productivity and achieve their goals.

Bottleneck also takes a highly personalized approach to service, working closely with clients to understand their unique needs and goals and offering tailored solutions that meet their specific requirements. This enables clients to work more efficiently, achieve greater results, and focus on the tasks that matter most to their success.

By providing this unique value proposition, Bottleneck has established itself as a leader in the distant assistant industry and differentiated itself from traditional virtual assistant services.

Over 1,600 pre-built scrapers for web scraping or automation projects. Scrape social media, Google Maps, Google Search, YouTube, and more.

+ Develop with open-source tools

Use distributed queues of URLs to crawl. Store structured data or binary files. Export datasets in Excel, CSV, JSON, JSONL, XML, RSS, or HTML table.

+ Monitor performance over time
Inspect all Actor runs, their logs, and runtime costs. Listen to events and get custom automated alerts.

SnapSuite helps contractors improve scheduling, manage project costs, and eliminate the stress of managing paperwork.

SnapSuite is an all-in-one solution for the construction and skilled trade industries, that allows field service companies to easily dispatch technicians, manage projects and easily generate complex quotes in a snap. We help construction companies move away from outdated software and towards better scheduling and business management systems that increase efficiency. 

FEATURES
- A scheduling system for real field workers
- Simple tools to help you track your project costs
- Send invoices and get paid faster
- Integrates with QuickBooks

Many small business owners in the skilled trade industries keep track of projects manually by using white boards, Excel spreadsheets and emails. They often use several disconnected tools just to keep track of 1 client.  Sales staff use Word for quotation templates, then they crunch the numbers in Excel, then send everything to the client as a PDF using Outlook, then they use a calendar to remind them to follow up. Once the client has agreed to the quote, the service or project manager uses Excel or a white board to track the job, getting reports and pictures from staff by text or email and printing hard copies or transferring digital copies to the customer’s file. Then it's accountings turn to step in!

With SnapSuite this whole process is streamlined. SnapSuite was created to help construction businesses improve efficiency. We eliminate manual steps from your day-to-day operations by implementing easy to use software to help you save time and cut costs.  

SnapSuite allows business owners and management to easily analyze real-time reports, enabling them to make smarter business decisions and grow their business.","SnapSuite is an all-in-one business management software solution for skilled trade and distribution companies, that allows business owners to automate processes.Seller DetailsSellerSnapSuiteTwitter@snapsuiteio50 Twitter followersDBOverview Provided by:Dwain BrowneDedicated to helping contractors improve profitability and customer satisfaction on every job!",,No reviews available,,,"Name: Field Service Management Software

Make sure your employees and customers are who they say they are... Always.

They’re fully-cloud based, so there’s no software for you to install (of course, hybrid and on-site versions are also available). And they require nothing more of users than their own mobile phone and the IDs they already have — no technology for them to buy, no fobs or dongles to carry, no codes or pins to type, no forms to fill out, no CAPTCHA puzzles to solve, no passwords to remember — ever.
The BlockID platform is designed to ensure identity is our number one focus at all times.
The use of Blockchain technology makes your BlockID-powered ecosystem unhackable.

Despite what some people might tell you, the problem may not be your salesmanship or your pitch—it could be a problem with your qualification methodology.

MEDDIC is the most renowned Sales Qualification Methodology, applicable to any Enterprise Sales Process which is rather complex. The definition of MEDDIC is the acronym it represents, composed of six elements. They represent the MEDDIC checklist as described below:

METRICS: Measure the potential gain leading to the economic benefit of your solution vs. competition.
ECONOMIC BUYER : Identify and meet the person who has the ultimate word to release funds to purchase.
DECISION PROCESS: Know and Influence the process defined by the client to make purchase decision.
DECISION CRITERIA: Know and Influence the criteria defined by the client to make purchase decision.
IDENTIFY PAIN: Identify and Analyze the pains which require your solution to be relieved.
CHAMPION : Identify, Qualify, Develop and Test your Champion or your Internal Seller.
In a nutshell, MEDDIC tells you that if you do the above in any complex B-to-B sales campaign, you win the sale.

We offer both ONLINE and IN-PERSON training and workshop.

Both programs include all the courses that you see here:
https://trainings.meddic.academy/
The main training, being the full MEDDIC bundle, lasts 2 hours approx (10 short 10-15 minutes mini courses):
https://trainings.meddic.academy/bundles/full-meddic-course
The bundle is composed of the MEDDIC original courses plus modules which are exclusively available at MEDDIC Academy (such as ""ROI"" or ""How to Develop Champions"").

The training and workshop are facilitated by Darius Lahoutifard, one of the initial sales leaders at PTC, where MEDDIC was born. Unlike other MEDDIC consultants Darius was not just a training facilitator or a VAR Manager at PTC, but a VP managing a Direct Sales team. More about him here:
https://www.linkedin.com/in/meddic/

To see him in action, try this free ""Introduction to MEDDIC"" course.

Codegram was born in 2009 from the hearts of 3 talented high-profile coders whose passion for building humane technology brought them together. Disenchanted by the traditional prioritisation of price over quality, they had the ambition to build an ethical company that would allow them to offer high-level solutions with no restrictions.

Priding itself on its diversity and inclusion, Codegram has grown into a 30+ team of international experts in multiple fields, evolving from a technology firm to a full-service digital agency backed by a wide range of success stories. We have extremely high standards and we work hard to exceed them redefining the limits of digital innovation.

In parallel to our work with each client, we are the organisers of more than ten editions of worldwide technical conferences trusted by a total of more than 5,000 attendees from 50+ different countries. We believe in people, in synergies and connections. Innovation is in our DNA and we strongly trust in digital evolution for business revolution.",,,2,4.0,,"Name: Software Developer Services Providers

MDaemon Server migration tool is an excellent product that can upload MDaemon Server profile data automatically in the software panel from default storage location. 

After uploading MDaemon Server profile data in the software panel, users can preview all MDaemon folders in the software panel such as Emails, Contacts, Calendars, Tasks, Notes, Files, Inbox, Sent Items, Deleted Items, etc. Even it automatically counts the total number of items in each folder and after that preview them in the software panel. Users can also check or uncheck only required folders from whole database.

Forensic MDaemon Converter software is also able to analyse MDaemon server data by previewing in Hex View, Message Header View, Raw Message View, and Content View. This product is specially developed for MDaemon Server forensic investigation, therefore 4n6 software developers added a separate option to export MDaemon emails into Adobe PDF printable documents. Even forensic investigators can use resultant PDF files for legal use.

After selecting specific MDaemon folders from software interface, press Export button and choose a saving option from dropdown menu. After that select a destination folder to store output data and hit on the Save button to start MDaemon server migration process. MDaemon Server Converter has a separate option to extract email addresses, phone numbers into simple text files while attachments can be exported in real available file extensions.

The tool also provides several advanced but common features like multiple file naming options to manage output data by Subject, From-Subject, From-Date-Subject, Year-Month-Day-Hour-Minute-Second-Subject, Message Auto Increment, Custom Naming, etc. During MDaemon Server migration process if software found bad sectors, then it will automatically skip the corrupted data conversion. Even it will create a log report to show error log report.

MDaemon Converter software also has an isolated option to export MDaemon contacts into vCard contacts and CSV contacts. MDaemon calendars can be stored in standard ICS file extension. This software preserves actual folder or sub-folder structure; therefore, users can easily understand the output data. It also holds email attachments, subject, signature, time, date, year, hyperlinks, headings, inline images, internet header, etc.","4n6 MDaemon Converter is an all-in-one toolkit to convert MDaemon Server profile data in several email formats (.eml, .pst, .mbox), document formats (.pdf, .txt, .html, .csv, .vcf, .ics) and all cloud-based email services (Gmail, Google Workspace, Outlook.com, Microsoft 365, Yahoo Mail, etc.).

John Snow Labs’ NLP Lab supports the end-to-end process from starting an annotation project to the deployment of a trained model, all without writing a line of code. 
Based on an auto-scaling architecture powered by Kubernetes, it can scale to many teams and projects. Enterprise-grade security is provided for free including support for air-gap environments, zero data sharing, role-based access, full audit trails, MFA, and identity provider integrations. It allows powerful experiments for model training and finetuning, model testing, and model deployment as API endpoints.","John Snow Labs Annotation Lab is a Free End-to-End No-Code platform for data labeling and DL model training.

If he finds it difficult to find his desired product in your store, he is more likely to abandon the store. 
 

 If you have thousands of products with varying attributes, you must have some sort of a mechanism by which customers can reach their desired product easily. This is where our Magento 2 sorting extension comes in. It allows your customers to sort products by 14 different parameters on category and search pages. For example, if a customer wants to find the cheapest product in a certain category, he can sort products by price in ascending order. If he wants to find the most rated products, he can sort it by rating, and so on. 
 

 Improved product sorting improves customer's shopping experience and increases conversions. 
 

 Features:
 

 - Offer 14 product sorting options
 - Reorder sorting options
 - Set the default sorting option","The quicker and easier a customer finds the product he is looking for, the higher the chances of him purchasing it. If he finds it difficult to find his desired product in your store, he is more likely to abandon the store. 
 

 If you have thousands of products with varying attributes, you must have some sort of a mechanism by which customers can reach their desired product easily. This is where our Magento 2 sorting extension comes in. It allows your customers to sort products by 14 different parameters on category and search pages. For example, if a customer wants to find the cheapest product in a certain category, he can sort products by price in ascending order. If he wants to find the most rated products, he can sort it by rating, and so on. 
 

 Improved product sorting improves customer's shopping experience and increases conversions.

Zimmerwriter è un software b2b o b2c? 
Unfortunately, I can't definitively determine whether Zimmerwriter is a B2B or B2C software without more information. Here's why:

What is Zimmerwriter?

I couldn't find any software or company called ""Zimmerwriter."" It's possible that:
The name is misspelled. If you rephrase the question with the correct spelling, I might be able to find it.
It's a smaller or very niche software. More details about what it does would help me categorize it.
B2B vs. B2C Explained

B2B (Business-to-Business): Software designed for use by other businesses. Examples include project management tools, customer relationship management (CRM) software, and accounting software.
B2C (Business-to-Consumer): Software designed for individual consumers. Examples include games, music streaming apps, and personal finance software.
How to Tell if a Software is B2B or B2C

Consider these factors:

Target audience: Who is the software designed for? Businesses or individuals?
Features: Does the software focus on problems businesses generally face (e.g., collaboration, data management), or more personal needs (e.g., entertainment, budgeting)?
Pricing: Is the pricing structured for enterprise-level budgets (B2B) or individual subscriptions (B2C)?
Website: Check the software's website. The language and marketing often indicate their target market.
Please provide any additional details you have about Zimmerwriter, and I'll gladly help you determine if it's B2B or B2C!

https://www.rankingtactics.com/zimmwriter/
Absolutely! Based on my analysis of the ZimmWriter website, it appears to be primarily a B2B (Business-to-Business) software. Here's why:

Target Audience:

Content Marketers and Bloggers: The software focuses heavily on streamlining content creation and SEO optimization, tasks that are vital for businesses trying to attract and engage online audiences.
Agencies: The ability to handle bulk content generation would be particularly useful for agencies managing multiple clients.
Features:

SEO Focus: Features like the SEO Blog Writer and Topical Authority Generator point towards helping businesses improve their search engine rankings and content strategy, which is crucial for business visibility
Content Generation: Tools for creating blogs, articles, and even AI image generation are primarily valuable in a business context for websites, marketing materials, and social media.
Collaboration Potential: While not explicitly stated, the ability to manage bulk content projects could suggest collaborative features suitable for B2B teams.
Pricing:

While pricing isn't publicly listed, the language on the website suggests a cost structure based on usage volume, which is more typical in B2B models where businesses scale their needs.
Website Language:

The website emphasizes benefits like increased traffic, higher search rankings, and time savings. These address pain points common to businesses.
Overall: While individuals might find ZimmWriter useful for personal blogging, its emphasis on SEO, bulk content generation, and features like Scraping Surgeon suggest it's primarily designed to serve the needs of businesses and agencies.
